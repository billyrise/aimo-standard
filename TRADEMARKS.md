| ✅ | "Compatible with AIMO Standard" |
| ✅ | "Implements AIMO Standard v0.0.1" |

## Prohibited Uses

The following uses are **prohibited** without explicit written permission:

| Prohibited | Reason |
| ---------- | ------ |
| ❌ Using "AIMO" or "Certified AIMO" as your product/company name | Creates confusion with official project |
| ❌ Implying official certification where none exists | Misleads users about conformance status |
| ❌ Using AIMO marks in domain names | Creates confusion with official resources |
| ❌ Modifying AIMO logos (when available) | Dilutes brand identity |
| ❌ Using marks in a way suggesting official endorsement | Misleads about relationship with project |
| ❌ Registering AIMO-related trademarks | Conflicts with project rights |

### Prohibited Examples

| Prohibited | Why |
| ---------- | --- |
| "AIMO Governance Platform" (as product name) | Uses AIMO as primary brand |
| "Certified AIMO Compliant" (without certification) | Implies non-existent certification |
| "Official AIMO Partner" (without agreement) | Implies endorsement |
| "aimo-standard.com" (domain registration) | Conflicts with official domain |

## Conformance Claims

### What You Can Claim

If your implementation passes all normative requirements:

> "This product implements AIMO Standard v0.0.1. Conformance was verified using the official AIMO Standard validator."

### What You Cannot Claim

- "AIMO Certified" (no certification program exists)
- "Official AIMO implementation" (unless you are a maintainer)
- "Endorsed by AIMO Standard" (unless explicitly granted)

### Evidence for Claims

To support a conformance claim, you should:

1. Run the official validator against your evidence bundle
2. Document the validator version and results
3. Specify which AIMO Standard version you conform to
4. Update claims when upgrading to new versions

## Logo Usage (When Available)

When official logos are published:

- Use only unmodified versions from official sources
- Maintain clear space around the logo
- Do not stretch, rotate, or alter colors
- Do not combine with other logos in a way suggesting partnership
