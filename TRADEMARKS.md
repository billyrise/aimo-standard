## Prohibited Uses

The following uses are **prohibited** without explicit written permission:

| Prohibited | Reason |

### Prohibited Examples

| Prohibited | Why |
| ---------- | --- |
| "AIMO Governance Platform" (as product name) | Uses AIMO as primary brand |
| "Certified AIMO Compliant" (without certification) | Implies non-existent certification |
| "Official AIMO Partner" (without agreement) | Implies endorsement |
| "aimo-standard.com" (domain registration) | Conflicts with official domain |

## Conformance Claims

### What You Can Claim

If your implementation passes all normative requirements:

> "This product implements AIMO Standard v0.0.1. Conformance was verified using the official AIMO Standard validator."

### What You Cannot Claim
