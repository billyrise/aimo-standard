# v0.1 Audit Object Model — scope decision

**Status**: Design memo for v0.1  
**Purpose**: Define which audit objects are MUST in v0.1 and which are reserved or future. Single source for scope; [00_manifest.md](../00_manifest.md), [CHANGELOG.md](../../changelog/CHANGELOG.md), and [MIGRATION.md](../../MIGRATION.md) reference this file for consistency.

## v0.1 MUST (normative — “actually provided” in v0.1)

| Area | What is required |
|------|------------------|
| **Evidence** | Root `evidence[]`; schema `aimo-ev.schema.json`. Required for any submission. |
| **Dictionary** | Root `dictionary`; schema `aimo-dictionary.schema.json`. Required for code validation. |
| **Root structure** | `aimo-standard.schema.json`: `version`, `dictionary`, `evidence`. Optional at root: `request`, `review`, `exception`, `renewal`, `change_log`. |
| **Evidence Bundle structure** | When submitting a *bundle* (directory): `manifest.json` at root; `object_index` / `payload_index` with `sha256`; `signing.signatures` non-empty with at least one signature whose `targets` include `manifest.json`; `hash_chain` with `covers` including `manifest.json` and `objects/index.json`. Schema: `evidence_bundle_manifest.schema.json`. See [09-evidence-bundle-structure](../../docs/en/standard/current/09-evidence-bundle-structure.md). |
| **ID policy** | EV = Evidence artifact ID only; LG = Log/Event Type (taxonomy). Validator rejects `evidence[].codes.EV`. See [04b-id-policy-namespace](../../docs/en/standard/current/04b-id-policy-namespace.md). |

**v0.1 audit submission minimum set** (one-page view): root JSON with `version`, `dictionary`, `evidence`; or an Evidence Bundle directory satisfying the structure above. Lifecycle objects (request, review, exception, renewal, change_log) are optional but recommended where applicable.

## v0.1 reserved only (not MUST)

The following prefixes/objects are **reserved** for future use. v0.1 does **not** require them as top-level arrays or separate schemas; validators do not enforce their presence or reference integrity in v0.1.

| Prefix / object | Description (future) |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| **RQ** (Requirement) | Requirement objects |
| **CT** (Control) | Control objects |
| **CL** (Claim) | Claim objects |
| **TP** (Test) | Test objects |
| **FD** (Finding) | Finding objects |
| **RM** (Remediation) | Remediation objects |
| **AP** (Approval) | Approval objects |
| **CH** (VersionChange) | Version change objects |
| **PR** (Profile) | Profile identifier namespace (e.g. PR-ISO42001-v0.1) — in use for Profile JSONs; not a root object type. |
| **Scope** | May be narrative or optional root field; no separate schema required in v0.1. |

## Future: D1 / D5 / D6 and full object model

**Reference relationships** (when the full object model is adopted):

- Control → Claim → Evidence  
- Test → Evidence  
- Finding → Remediation  
- Approval, Scope, VersionChange as supporting objects  

**Validator tasks D1, D5, D6** (reference integrity, reproducibility, workpaper) will apply **when** the corresponding object types and schemas are introduced. v0.1 does not define or require these object schemas; therefore D1/D5/D6 are **out of scope** for v0.1. Enabling condition: object schemas (e.g. for Requirement, Control, Claim, Test, Finding, Remediation, Approval, VersionChange) are published and referenced by the validator in a future standard version.
