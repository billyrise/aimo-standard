# v0.1 Audit Object Model — scope decision

**Status**: Design memo for v0.1  
**Purpose**: Define which of the 10 audit objects are MUST in v0.1 and which are optional/skeleton.

## v0.1 MUST (normative)

- **Evidence** — already in root (`evidence[]`); schema `aimo-ev.schema.json`. Required for any submission.
- **Dictionary** — already in root (`dictionary`); schema `aimo-dictionary.schema.json`. Required for code validation.
- **Root structure** — `aimo-standard.schema.json`: `version`, `dictionary`, `evidence`, plus optional lifecycle objects (`request`, `review`, `exception`, `renewal`, `change_log`).

## v0.1 optional / future

- **Scope** — referenced in design; v0.1 allows scope to be described in narrative or optional root field; no separate schema required for v0.1.
- **Requirement, Control, Claim, Test, Finding, Remediation, Approval, VersionChange** — design book 4.1–4.4; reserved for future. v0.1 does **not** require these as top-level arrays or separate schemas. When present (e.g. in Evidence Bundle objects), validators may check reference integrity in a later revision.

## Reference relationships (for future implementation)

When the full object model is adopted, the intended references are:

- Control → Claim → Evidence
- Test → Evidence
- Finding → Remediation
- Approval, Scope, VersionChange as supporting objects

Validator tasks D1 (reference integrity), D5 (reproducibility), D6 (workpaper) apply **when** the corresponding object types and schemas exist; in v0.1 they are out of scope.
