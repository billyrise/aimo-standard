# v0.2 Roadmap (informative)

**Status**: Planning. Target timeline: 2026 Q4–2027.  
**Purpose**: Single reference for planned major changes that are out of scope for v0.1.1.

This document is **informative**. The normative specification for any released version is the standard and schemas for that version.

---

## 1. Audit object model (SSOT)

- Fix a single source of truth (SSOT) for audit objects: Requirement, Control, Claim, Evidence, Test, Finding, Remediation, Approval, Scope, VersionChange.
- Define mandatory fields (ID, description, responsible party, references) and an ID policy that prevents collisions (prefix + namespace + version).
- Publish normative schemas and validator support for reference integrity (e.g. Control → Test → Evidence).

---

## 2. External framework bridge (output profiles)

- Extend Profiles so that one Evidence Bundle can be transformed into regulation-specific outputs (e.g. EU Annex IV technical documentation, GPAI Model Documentation Form, ISO 42001 SoA, NIST AI RMF mapping).
- Machine-readable Coverage Map and output templates so validators can detect uncovered requirements.
- “One-click” export to target formats (PDF/Word/XBRL) as a standard annex or tooling.

---

## 3. Evidence-as-Code (integrity and provenance)

- Normative requirements for Evidence Bundle: hash chain, digital signature verification (not just presence), timestamp, and provenance (who produced what, when, from what inputs).
- Alignment with SLSA-style provenance and/or in-toto for supply-chain integrity.
- Reproducibility: same inputs and version → same result; change tracking for model/config/data updates.

---

## 4. Test procedure standard library

- Standard test templates per control (purpose, preconditions, verification steps, sampling, expected evidence, failure conditions).
- Align with ISAE 3000 (subject matter, criteria, evidence, conclusion) and SOC 2 / ISO 19011 vocabulary.
- Versioned library with stable test IDs.

---

## 5. Operational lifecycle

- Event-driven process: Intake → Review → Exception → Renewal → Change → Decommission with required logs, evidence, approvers, and SLA metadata.
- Align with EU technical documentation maintenance (e.g. Article 11) and Japanese AI guidelines (governance and continuous improvement).

---

## 6. Industry and jurisdiction profiles

- Optional industry profiles (e.g. financial services, manufacturing, healthcare) to prioritize evidence and map to sector regulation.
- Jurisdiction-specific profiles (e.g. EU, US, UK, Singapore) for additional or mandatory fields and retention.

---

## 7. Justified non-compliance (JNC)

- Optional mechanism to record and justify intentional non-compliance with specific requirements (rationale, risk assessment, approver, review schedule). Informative schema and guidance only; no normative conformance claim.

---

## 8. Evidence Bundle and OSCAL

- Define a standard way to link Evidence Bundle elements to Control/Requirement identifiers for export to NIST OSCAL or similar audit automation formats. AIMO remains the implementation-focused layer; OSCAL is a target format.
