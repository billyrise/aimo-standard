# Governance (SSOT)

## Single Source of Truth

## Editable Areas
Edits are allowed only in:

## Normative vs Non-Normative
- Normative: MUST/SHALL requirements, schema constraints, code definitions, validator rule definitions.
- Non-normative: explanations, how-to, rationale, examples.

## Release Requirements
A release tag `vX.Y.Z` MUST produce:
- Versioned spec snapshot (past version)
- PDF (official)
- Packaged artifacts and checksums
- Changelog snapshot
