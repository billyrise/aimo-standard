# Blocker A: /latest reference safety — resolution

**Issue**: Public `/latest/` was pointing to an outdated version (e.g. 0.0.3) when a newer release was intended.

**Root cause**: `/latest/` is updated only by the **release workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`), which runs on **tag push** (`v*`). If no tag is pushed after new work is merged, the site is never updated.

**Resolution**:

1. **Recovery**: Push the correct release tag (e.g. `v0.1.0`) so that the release workflow runs and deploys that version, then sets `latest` to it via `mike deploy --push --update-aliases`.
2. **Prevention**: Use tag-based release as the only way to update `/latest/`. No manual edits to gh-pages for the alias.
3. **Detection**: The workflow `monitor-latest-drift.yml` runs daily (09:00 JST) and fails if the public `/latest/` redirect target does not match the latest `v*` tag (see `tooling/checks/check_public_latest_drift.py`).

**Audit citation**: For evidence and reproducibility, cite versioned URLs (`https://standard.aimoaas.com/X.Y.Z/...`) rather than `/latest/`. See VERSIONING.md and the Versions page.
