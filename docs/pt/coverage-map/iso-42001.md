# ISO/IEC 42001 mapping

> Traceability shortcuts: Taxonomy → Minimum Evidence → Validator → Human Oversight Protocol.

- [Taxonomy](../standard/current/03-taxonomy.md)
- [Minimum Evidence Requirements](../artifacts/minimum-evidence.md)
- [Log Schemas](../artifacts/log-schemas/index.md)
- [Validator](../validator/index.md)
- [Human Oversight Protocol](../governance/human-oversight-protocol.md)

This page maps selected ISO/IEC 42001 (AI management system) themes to AIMO evidence and artifacts. It is for explainability only; it does not guarantee conformity to ISO/IEC 42001. Verify against the published standard.
