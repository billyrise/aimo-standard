# Conformance

This section defines how organizations claim compliance with the AIMO Standard and what evidence is expected.

## Purpose

- **What you can claim**: Alignment with the AIMO Standard's evidence structure and traceability requirements.
- **What you cannot claim**: Legal compliance, certification, or regulatory approval. See [Responsibility Boundary](../governance/responsibility-boundary.md).

## Expected Evidence

To demonstrate conformance, organizations must provide:

1. **Evidence Bundle**: Structured EV records per [Artifacts](../artifacts/index.md) and [Minimum Evidence Requirements](../artifacts/minimum-evidence.md).
2. **Validator Results**: Passing output from the validator — see [Validator](../validator/index.md).
3. **Version Reference**: Explicit AIMO Standard version — see [Versions](../standard/versions/index.md).

## Non-overclaim

!!! warning "Important"
    Conformance to the AIMO Standard demonstrates **evidence readiness and traceability**, not legal compliance or certification. See [Responsibility Boundary](../governance/responsibility-boundary.md).
