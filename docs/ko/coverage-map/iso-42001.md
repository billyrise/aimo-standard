# ISO/IEC 42001 mapping

> Traceability shortcuts: Taxonomy → Minimum Evidence → Validator → Human Oversight Protocol.

- [Taxonomy](../../standard/current/03-taxonomy/)
- [Minimum Evidence Requirements](../../artifacts/minimum-evidence/)
- [Log Schemas](../../artifacts/log-schemas/)
- [Validator](../../validator/)
- [Human Oversight Protocol](../../governance/human-oversight-protocol/)

This page maps selected ISO/IEC 42001 (AI management system) themes to AIMO evidence and artifacts. It is for explainability only; it does not guarantee conformity to ISO/IEC 42001. Verify against the published standard.

## Market adoption / certification trend

ISO/IEC 42001 certification is increasingly used as a **management-system layer** for AI governance. Organizations seeking certification work with accredited certification bodies; AIMO provides an evidence structure and validator that can support readiness and audit handoff, not certification itself.

## From ISO/IEC 42001 to audit reality (ISO/IEC 42006)

**ISO/IEC 42006** (2025) specifies requirements for bodies that audit and certify AIMS against ISO/IEC 42001. It raises expectations for **evidence rigor**: documented controls, traceability, and consistency. AIMO’s Evidence Bundle, validator, and [Conformance levels](../../conformance/) (Foundation, Operational, Audit-Ready) help adopters produce structured, verifiable evidence that auditors can use. See [ISO/IEC 42006](iso-42006.md) for more.
