This page explains **ISO/IEC 42006** and how AIMO Standard supports adopters preparing for AIMS audits. It is informative only; it does not constitute certification or legal advice.

## What is ISO/IEC 42006?

**ISO/IEC 42006** specifies requirements for bodies that **audit and certify** AI management systems (AIMS) against **ISO/IEC 42001**. It builds on ISO/IEC 17021-1 (conformity assessment — requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of management systems). Published in **2025** (e.g. 2025-07), it formalizes competence and process expectations for certification bodies performing AIMS audits.

## Why it matters for AIMO adopters

Certification bodies applying ISO/IEC 42006 will expect **auditable evidence** of management-system controls: documented policies, roles, operational controls, monitoring, and improvement. AIMO helps structure that evidence into a consistent bundle (manifest, hashes, lifecycle records) and provides a validator for structural consistency. It does **not** replace the auditor’s judgment or the certification decision.

## AIMO support

| AIMO component | How it supports audit readiness |
| --- | --- |
| **Evidence Bundle + Validator** | Auditable structure: manifest, object_index, payload_index, hash_chain, signing. Validator checks presence and integrity; output can be attached to the bundle for auditors. |
| **Conformity levels** | Foundation / Operational / Audit-Ready describe evidence maturity (traceability, lifecycle trail, attestation, handoff index). They indicate readiness level, not certification. |
| **Coverage Map + Profiles** | Explainability and requirements traceability: mappings from AIMO artifacts to ISO 42001 clause families and, where applicable, to EU or other frameworks. |

See [Conformance](../../conformance/) for level definitions and [ISO/IEC 42001](iso-42001.md) for the underlying standard mapping.
