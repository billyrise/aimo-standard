# Coverage Map

## Important: Scope of this Coverage Map (No automatic compliance)

This Coverage Map provides **traceability** between AIMO Standard elements and major regulations/standards to accelerate audit explanations and evidence readiness.
**It does NOT automatically guarantee compliance** with any specific regulation or standard.
Applicable obligations vary by role (e.g., provider/deployer), use case, risk classification, transition timelines, and authoritative interpretations/certification schemes.

## How to use this map (traceability workflow)

1. Start from the external requirement (e.g., ISO/NIST/EU AI Act/ISMS) and find the mapped AIMO Standard elements.
2. Use the linked AIMO elements to identify required artifacts and minimum evidence requirements.
3. Validate completeness and consistency using the Validator, and apply human review where required (see [Human Oversight Protocol](../governance/human-oversight-protocol.md)).

**Key resources:**

- [Taxonomy](../standard/current/03-taxonomy.md) — classification codes
- [Minimum Evidence Requirements](../artifacts/minimum-evidence.md) — MUST-level checklist
- [Evidence Bundle](../artifacts/evidence-bundle.md) — bundle structure and TOC
- [Log Schemas](../artifacts/log-schemas/index.md) — Shadow AI / agent activity evidence
- [Validator](../validator/index.md) — structural consistency checks
- [Human Oversight Protocol](../governance/human-oversight-protocol.md) — machine vs. human review boundary

This section maps AIMO Standard evidence and artifacts to external frameworks and regulations for audit explainability. It does **not** guarantee compliance or provide legal advice.
