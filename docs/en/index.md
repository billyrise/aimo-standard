# AIMO Standard

**AIMO** stands for **AI Management Office**. This site hosts the human-readable AIMO Standard specification.

## Why agentic AI audits are needed now

Enterprise AI risk is increasingly driven by **Shadow AI (unapproved AI use)** and **agentic AI (autonomous agents) with broad tool privileges**, making traditional ISMS/IT controls insufficient for traceability and audit explanations.
AIMO Standard classifies AI usage with a shared language (Taxonomy), defines minimum evidence requirements, and enforces consistency via a Validator—accelerating auditability and remediation.
Note: AIMO Standard does not provide legal advice or automatically guarantee compliance with any specific regulation/standard (see [Coverage Map](coverage-map/)).

- [Taxonomy](standard/current/03-taxonomy/) (shared language)
- [Minimum Evidence Requirements](artifacts/minimum-evidence/)
- [Validator](validator/) (consistency checks)

**Top-level sections**

1. [Standard](standard/) — Specification ([Current](standard/current/) | [Versions](standard/versions/)), [Conformance](conformance/), [Coverage Map](coverage-map/)
2. [Artifacts](artifacts/) — Taxonomy, code system, dictionary, evidence templates, schemas
3. [Validator](validator/) — Rules, reference checks, how to run
4. [Examples](examples/) — End-to-end and minimal samples
5. [Releases](releases/) — Changelog, migration, checksums, PDF
6. [Governance](governance/) — Versioning, security, license, trademarks, [Contributing](contributing/localization/)
