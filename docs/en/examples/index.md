# Examples

This section points to end-to-end and minimal examples that show how artifacts are assembled.

- **Minimal bundle**: `examples/minimal/` in the repository (e.g., `sample_ev.json`, `sample_dictionary.json`).
- **Evidence Bundle (minimal)**: `examples/evidence_bundle_minimal/` — root.json with optional request, review, change_log; see [Evidence Bundle](../artifacts/evidence-bundle.md) and [Minimum Evidence](../artifacts/minimum-evidence.md).
- **Schema alignment**: validate against `schemas/jsonschema/` and [Standard](../standard/current/index.md).
- **Audit-ready packaging**: see the [Trust Package](../governance/trust-package.md).

Detailed scenario coverage is added in later change units.
