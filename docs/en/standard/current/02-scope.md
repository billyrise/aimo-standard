# Scope

This standard specifies artifacts and validation rules to enable consistent analysis and reporting.

Out of scope:
- proprietary inference logic
- vendor-specific scoring/weighting implementations

## Scope alignment with Management System standards (PDCA)

AIMO adds an **AI-specific taxonomy and evidence artifacts** that help operationalize management-system controls (Plan–Do–Check–Act) and make outputs auditable. It can be used **alongside** ISO/IEC 42001 and other management-system standards; it does not replace their texts. Coverage Map and profiles provide informative mappings only — adopters must verify against the authoritative framework.

**Adopter responsibilities**

- Verify scope and applicability against the relevant management-system or regulatory text.
- Maintain evidence and run the validator as part of audit preparation; certification decisions remain with accredited certification bodies.
- See [Responsibility Boundary](../../governance/responsibility-boundary/) for what AIMO does and does not provide.
