# AIMO Standard Coverage Map (SSOT)
# Purpose: map external framework requirements to AIMO evidence/artifacts for explainability.
# This mapping does NOT guarantee compliance or constitute legal advice.

meta:
  version: "0.1.0"
  last_updated: "2026-01-31"
  methodology: "Informative mapping only. Readers must verify against authoritative framework texts. AIMO supports explainability and evidence readiness; it does not guarantee conformity to any external standard or regulation."
