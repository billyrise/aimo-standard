# AIMO Standard

**AIMO** stands for **AI Management Office**. This site hosts the human-readable AIMO Standard specification.

## Why agentic AI audits are needed now

Enterprise AI risk is increasingly driven by **Shadow AI (unapproved AI use)** and **agentic AI (autonomous agents) with broad tool privileges**, making traditional ISMS/IT controls insufficient for traceability and audit explanations.
AIMO Standard classifies AI usage with a shared language (Taxonomy), defines minimum evidence requirements, and enforces consistency via a Validator—accelerating auditability and remediation.
Note: AIMO Standard does not provide legal advice or automatically guarantee compliance with any specific regulation/standard (see [Coverage Map](coverage-map/)).

- [Taxonomy](standard/current/03-taxonomy/) (shared language)
- [Minimum Evidence Requirements](artifacts/minimum-evidence/)
- [Validator](validator/) (consistency checks)

# Overview

**AIMO** stands for **AI Management Office**. AIMO Standard defines:
- a shared taxonomy
- a code system
- an initial dictionary
- an EV template
- validator checks (spec + minimal reference implementation)

This repository publishes:
- human-readable spec (HTML)
- machine-readable artifacts (schemas/templates/examples)
- official PDF releases

## Positioning: Companion to ISO/IEC 42001 (AIMS)

AIMO Standard is an **implementation accelerator for evidence readiness and explainability** that can be used to support ISO/IEC 42001–aligned AI Management Systems (AIMS) and to structure audit-ready evidence. It does not replace ISO/IEC 42001 or any other management-system standard; it adds a taxonomy, evidence bundle structure, and coverage mapping that help operationalize and evidence those controls.

**What AIMO is**

- Taxonomy and code system for AI governance classification
- Evidence bundle structure (manifest, object_index, payload_index, integrity)
- Validator and coverage mapping for traceability
- Conformance levels (Foundation, Operational, Audit-Ready) — AIMO-only maturity tiers for evidence packaging

**What AIMO is not**

- Legal advice
- ISO certification or a substitute for certification
- A guarantee of regulatory compliance
- A replacement for auditor judgment or accredited certification bodies

**Why now**

- **ISO/IEC 42006** (published 2025-07) specifies requirements for bodies auditing and certifying AI management systems against ISO/IEC 42001, raising expectations for auditable evidence and traceability.
- The **EU AI Act** is in progressive application (2025–2027); harmonised standards, when published in the Official Journal, will provide presumption of conformity. The EU AI Office is preparing practical guidelines during 2026 (high-risk classification, Article 50 transparency, incidents, QMS elements).
- Adopters and certification bodies increasingly use ISO/IEC 42001 as a system layer for AI governance; AIMO helps structure evidence that supports that layer without claiming certification.

# Scope

This standard specifies artifacts and validation rules to enable consistent analysis and reporting.

Out of scope:
- proprietary inference logic
- vendor-specific scoring/weighting implementations

## Scope alignment with Management System standards (PDCA)

AIMO adds an **AI-specific taxonomy and evidence artifacts** that help operationalize management-system controls (Plan–Do–Check–Act) and make outputs auditable. It can be used **alongside** ISO/IEC 42001 and other management-system standards; it does not replace their texts. Coverage Map and profiles provide informative mappings only — adopters must verify against the authoritative framework.

**Adopter responsibilities**

- Verify scope and applicability against the relevant management-system or regulatory text.
- Maintain evidence and run the validator as part of audit preparation; certification decisions remain with accredited certification bodies.
- See [Responsibility Boundary](../../governance/responsibility-boundary/) for what AIMO does and does not provide.

# Taxonomy

The AIMO Taxonomy provides a structured classification system for categorizing AI systems, their uses, and associated governance requirements. It consists of **8 dimensions** with **91 codes** that enable consistent classification and evidence management across organizations.

## Purpose

The taxonomy serves three primary purposes from an audit perspective:

1. **Explainability**: Provides a common vocabulary for describing AI use cases across the organization, supporting clear communication with auditors and stakeholders.

2. **Evidence Readiness**: Enables systematic documentation of AI systems using a standardized classification, making evidence collection and review more efficient.

3. **Comparability**: Allows organizations to compare AI use cases across different contexts using consistent terminology.

## What It Is Not (Non-Overclaim)

!!! warning "Important"
    The AIMO Standard supports **explainability and evidence readiness**. It does **not** provide legal advice, guarantee compliance, or certify conformity to any regulation or framework. See [Responsibility Boundary](../../../governance/responsibility-boundary/) for details.

The taxonomy is a classification system only. It does not:

- Guarantee compliance with any law or regulation
- Replace professional legal, security, or compliance advice
- Certify conformity to external frameworks (ISO, NIST, EU AI Act, etc.)
- Provide risk assessments or control recommendations

## Examples of AI/agentic-specific risks (why an AI-specific standard is needed)

Traditional security controls (e.g., ISMS) alone often fail to capture LLM/agent-specific failure modes and autonomous agent deviations (e.g., unintended tool execution, recursive loops) in an **audit-explainable** manner.
AIMO Taxonomy provides a shared language to classify these AI-specific risks and connect them to evidence requirements and remediation workflows.

!!! warning "Reference examples only — not normative codes"
    The codes below are **illustrative placeholders** and are **NOT** part of the normative AIMO code system. They are reference examples for differentiation; the official code system follows the Standard definitions in [Codes](../04-codes/) and [Dictionary](../05-dictionary/).

- **AG-01** Runaway Loop / Recursion
- **AG-02** Unauthorized Tool Use (confused deputy-style misuse)
- **AG-03** Privilege Boundary Drift

Do not use AG-* in submissions; use normative dimensions and codes defined in Codes/Dictionary.

## Dimensions Overview

AIMO uses 8 dimensions to classify AI use cases. Each dimension has a unique 2-letter prefix.

| ID | Name | Code Count | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **FS** | Functional Scope | 6 | Which business function is supported |
| **UC** | Use Case Class | 30 | What type of task is performed |
| **DT** | Data Type | 10 | What data classifications are involved |
| **CH** | Channel | 8 | How users access the AI |
| **IM** | Integration Mode | 7 | How AI connects to enterprise systems |
| **RS** | Risk Surface | 8 | What risks are associated |
| **OB** | Outcome / Benefit | 7 | What benefits are expected |
| **LG** | Log/Event Type | 15 | What log/event/record type is required (request record, access log, etc.) |

**Total: 91 codes across 8 dimensions**

## How to Use

### Relationship with Evidence

Each evidence document references codes from multiple dimensions to classify the AI system or use case being documented. **EV** denotes evidence *artifact* identifiers (e.g. `evidence[].id`, `references[]`); **LG** denotes log/event *taxonomy* codes (e.g. `evidence[].codes.LG`). The 8-dimension classification enables:

- **Consistent categorization** across the organization
- **Risk-based filtering** by dimension values
- **Framework mapping** via Coverage Map

### Referencing the Dictionary

For complete code definitions including scope notes and examples, refer to the [Dictionary](../05-dictionary/).

### Example Classification

```
FS: FS-001 (End-user Productivity)
UC: UC-001 (General Q&A), UC-002 (Summarization)
DT: DT-002 (Internal), DT-004 (Personal Data)
CH: CH-001 (Web UI)
IM: IM-002 (SaaS Integrated)
RS: RS-001 (Data Leakage), RS-003 (Compliance Breach)
OB: OB-001 (Efficiency)

# Codes

This page defines the AIMO Code System format, naming conventions, and lifecycle management.

## Code Format

All AIMO codes follow the format: **`<PREFIX>-<TOKEN>`**

| Component | Description | Format | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<PREFIX>` | Dimension identifier | 2 uppercase letters | FS, UC, DT |
| `-` | Separator | Hyphen | - |
| `<TOKEN>` | Unique token within dimension | 3 digits (zero-padded) | 001, 002, 003 |

### Examples

- `FS-001` - Functional Scope: End-user Productivity
- `UC-005` - Use Case Class: Code Generation
- `DT-004` - Data Type: Personal Data
- `CH-003` - Channel: IDE Plugin
- `IM-002` - Integration Mode: SaaS Integrated
- `RS-001` - Risk Surface: Data Leakage
- `OB-001` - Outcome/Benefit: Efficiency
- `LG-001` - Log/Event Type: Request Record

## Namespaces

The AIMO taxonomy uses 8 dimension namespaces:

| ID | Name | Prefix | Code Count |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **FS** | Functional Scope | `FS-` | 6 |
| **UC** | Use Case Class | `UC-` | 30 |
| **DT** | Data Type | `DT-` | 10 |
| **CH** | Channel | `CH-` | 8 |
| **IM** | Integration Mode | `IM-` | 7 |
| **RS** | Risk Surface | `RS-` | 8 |
| **OB** | Outcome / Benefit | `OB-` | 7 |
| **LG** | Log/Event Type | `LG-` | 15 |

**Total: 91 codes across 8 dimensions**

### Namespace Rules

1. **Prefix is fixed**: The two-letter dimension prefix (FS, UC, etc.) is permanent and will never change.
2. **Zero-padding**: Tokens are always 3 digits, zero-padded (e.g., `001` not `1`).
3. **Sequential assignment**: New codes are assigned the next available number within a dimension.
4. **No reuse**: Removed codes are never reassigned to different meanings.

## Stability Rules

Code stability is a critical principle for audit traceability.

### ID Immutability

- **Code IDs are immutable** — once assigned, a code ID never changes meaning
- A code like `UC-001` will always mean "General Q&A" for its entire lifecycle
- If the meaning needs to change, a new code is created instead

### No Reuse Policy

- Deprecated or removed codes are **never reassigned** to different meanings
- This ensures historical evidence remains valid and traceable
- Example: If `UC-010` is deprecated, a new use case gets `UC-031` (not `UC-010`)

### Deprecation Before Removal

- Codes must be marked `deprecated` for at least one MINOR version before removal
- Removal only occurs in MAJOR version increments
- See [Lifecycle](#lifecycle) section for details

## Usage

### Required Dimensions

For each AI system or use case, you MUST specify at least one code from each required dimension:

| Dimension | Selection | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FS | Exactly 1 | Primary business function |
| UC | 1 or more | Task types performed |
| DT | 1 or more | Data classifications |
| CH | 1 or more | Access channels |
| IM | Exactly 1 | Integration mode |
| RS | 1 or more | Risk categories |
| LG | 1 or more | Log/event types |

### Optional Dimensions

| Dimension | Selection | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OB | 0 or more | Expected benefits (optional) |

### Code Composition

When documenting an AI system, codes from multiple dimensions are combined. The **composition priority** determines the order when listing codes:

1. FS (Functional Scope)
2. UC (Use Case Class)
3. DT (Data Type)
4. CH (Channel)
5. IM (Integration Mode)
6. RS (Risk Surface)
7. OB (Outcome / Benefit)
8. LG (Log/Event Type)

See [ID Policy / Namespace](../04b-id-policy-namespace/): **EV-** is reserved for Evidence *artifact* IDs only; taxonomy log/event dimension uses **LG-** (e.g. LG-001 … LG-015).

**Example composition:**

```
FS: FS-001
UC: UC-001, UC-002
DT: DT-002, DT-004
CH: CH-001
IM: IM-002
RS: RS-001, RS-003
OB: OB-001
LG: LG-001, LG-002
```

## Lifecycle

### Status Values

| Status | Description | Validator Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `active` | Currently valid and in use | Accepted |
| `deprecated` | Still valid but scheduled for removal | Accepted with warning |
| `removed` | No longer valid; do not use | Rejected |

### Lifecycle Metadata Fields

The dictionary tracks lifecycle with these fields:

| Field | Required | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | Yes | Current status | `active` |
| `introduced_in` | Yes | Version when code was added | `0.1.0` |
| `deprecated_in` | No | Version when marked deprecated | `1.2.0` |
| `removed_in` | No | Version when removed | `2.0.0` |
| `replaced_by` | No | Replacement code(s) | `UC-015` |
| `backward_compatible` | Yes | Whether change breaks existing usage | `true` |

### Deprecation Rules

1. Codes MUST be marked `deprecated` for at least one MINOR version before removal
2. Deprecated codes include `deprecated_in` version and `replaced_by` if applicable
3. Removal occurs only in MAJOR version increments
4. Deprecated codes remain valid for backward compatibility during the deprecation period

**Example timeline:**

| Version | Status | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.1.0 | `active` | Code `UC-010` introduced |
| 1.2.0 | `deprecated` | Marked deprecated, `replaced_by: UC-031` |
| 2.0.0 | `removed` | No longer accepted by validator |

### Versioning

Code changes follow [Semantic Versioning](../08-changelog/):

- **MAJOR**: Code removal or breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New codes added, codes deprecated
- **PATCH**: Definition clarifications only (no structural changes)

### Backward Compatibility

The `backward_compatible` field indicates whether a change breaks existing usage:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `true` | Existing evidence using this code remains valid |
| `false` | Existing evidence may need updates (MAJOR version change) |

## Validation

The validator checks:

1. All required dimensions have at least one code
2. Single-select dimensions have exactly one code
3. All codes exist in the current taxonomy dictionary
4. Code format matches `<PREFIX>-<TOKEN>` pattern (e.g., `UC-001`)
5. Deprecated codes are flagged with warnings

See [Validator](../07-validator/) for implementation details.

# ID Policy / Namespace (v0.1)

This page defines the **normative** ID policy for AIMO Standard v0.1 to avoid collisions between taxonomy codes and evidence artifact identifiers.

## Namespace Separation

| Prefix | Use | Scope | Example |
|--------|-----|--------|---------|
| **EV-** | **Evidence (artifact) ID only** | Unique identifier for an evidence *object* (record, document, bundle item) | `EV-20260115-001`, `EV-20260131-002` |
| **LG-** | **Log/Event Type (Taxonomy)** | Taxonomy dimension for *classifying* log/event/record types (request record, access log, etc.) | `LG-001`, `LG-002`, … `LG-015` |

- **EV** is reserved for **Evidence artifact IDs** (e.g. in `evidence[].id`, `references[]`). Do **not** use EV as a taxonomy dimension or as taxonomy codes in `evidence[].codes`.
- **LG** is the **Log/Event Type** taxonomy dimension. Use **only** `LG-xxx` codes (e.g. `LG-001`, `LG-007`) in taxonomy fields such as `evidence[].codes.LG`, Evidence Pack manifest `codes.LG`, and dictionary entries for log/event classification.

## Rationale

Previously, the taxonomy used **EV-001** … **EV-015** for "Evidence Type" (request record, access log, etc.). This collided with the use of **EV-** for **Evidence artifact IDs** (e.g. `evidence[].id`). To remove ambiguity:

- **Taxonomy (log/event classification)** → **LG-** (Log/Event Type): `LG-001` … `LG-015`.
- **Evidence (artifact identifier)** → **EV-** only: e.g. `EV-YYYYMMDD-NNN` or similar stable IDs.

Validators **must** reject:

- Use of **EV** as a taxonomy dimension in `evidence[].codes` (e.g. `"EV": ["EV-001"]`). Use **LG** and `LG-xxx` instead.
- Use of taxonomy codes **EV-001** … **EV-999** in any taxonomy/codes field; only **LG-xxx** are allowed for the log/event dimension.

## v0.1 prefix inventory

| Prefix | v0.1 status | Use |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| **EV-** | In use | Evidence artifact ID only (e.g. `evidence[].id`) |
| **LG-** | In use | Log/Event Type taxonomy dimension (`evidence[].codes.LG`) |
| **SC-** | In use | Scope (e.g. scope identifier) |
| **RQ-**, **CT-**, **CL-**, **TP-**, **FD-**, **RM-**, **AP-**, **CH-**, **PR-** | Reserved | Requirement, Control, Claim, Test Plan, Finding, Remediation, Approval, Change, Profile — for future use; not yet normative in v0.1 |

## References

- [Taxonomy](../03-taxonomy/) — dimension **LG: Log/Event Type**
- [Evidence Pack Template](../06-ev-template/) — `codes.LG` and `ev_codes` / `ev_type` use **LG-xxx**

# Dictionary

The AIMO Dictionary is the authoritative list of all valid codes within the taxonomy. It provides complete definitions for each code including labels, descriptions, and lifecycle information.

## What is Dictionary

The dictionary provides a complete, machine-readable set of all AIMO taxonomy codes. It contains:

- All 91 codes across 8 dimensions
- Labels and definitions (with translations in language packs)
- Lifecycle metadata (status, version introduced, deprecated, removed)
- Scope notes and examples for code usage

The dictionary enables:

1. **Evidence Templates**: Codes are used in EV templates to classify AI systems
2. **Validator**: The validator checks that all codes exist in the dictionary
3. **Coverage Map**: Codes enable mapping to external frameworks and regulations

!!! info "Single Source of Truth (SSOT)"
    The SSOT for the dictionary is:

    - **Structure**: `data/taxonomy/canonical.yaml` (codes, status, lifecycle)
    - **Translations**: `data/taxonomy/i18n/*.yaml` (labels, definitions per language)

    CSV files are **generated artifacts** for distribution. See [Releases](../../../releases/) for downloads.

!!! note "Standard release version vs dictionary/taxonomy versions"
    The AIMO Standard **release version** (site/release, e.g. `/0.1.2/`) and the **dictionary content version** (or **taxonomy schema version**) are not necessarily the same. In 0.1.x they often align; future releases may version them independently. For audit citations, prefer the Standard release version (`/X.Y.Z/`); in Evidence, state `taxonomy_version` and `dictionary_version` where applicable.

## Column Schema

The canonical dictionary uses **18 columns** (language-neutral structure):

### Identification Columns (5)

| # | Column | Required | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `standard_id` | Yes | Standard identifier | `AIMO-STD` |
| 2 | `standard_version` | Yes | SemVer format | `0.1.0` *(example; use the Standard release version you align to)* |
| 3 | `dimension_id` | Yes | Two-letter dimension ID | `FS`, `UC`, `DT` |
| 4 | `dimension_name` | Yes | Dimension name | `Functional Scope` |
| 5 | `code` | Yes | Full code | `UC-001` |

### Label and Definition Columns (4)

| # | Column | Required | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | `label` | Yes | Code label (max 50 chars) | `General Q&A` |
| 7 | `definition` | Yes | Code definition (1-2 sentences) | `General question answering...` |
| 8 | `scope_notes` | No | Usage scope clarification | `Low to medium risk...` |
| 9 | `examples` | No | Pipe-separated examples | `chatbot\|recommendation` |

!!! note "Translations"
    The canonical data model separates translations into language packs (`data/taxonomy/i18n/*.yaml`). Each language pack provides localized `dimension_name`, `label`, and `definition` values. See [Localization Guide](../../../contributing/localization/) for details.

### Lifecycle Columns (6)

| # | Column | Required | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10 | `status` | Yes | `active`, `deprecated`, `removed` | `active` |
| 11 | `introduced_in` | Yes | Version when added | `0.1.0` |
| 12 | `deprecated_in` | No | Version when deprecated | `1.2.0` |
| 13 | `removed_in` | No | Version when removed | `2.0.0` |
| 14 | `replaced_by` | No | Replacement code | `UC-015` |
| 15 | `backward_compatible` | Yes | `true` or `false` | `true` |

### Governance Columns (3)

| # | Column | Required | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 16 | `references` | No | External references | ISO/IEC 42001 |
| 17 | `owner` | No | Responsible party | `AIMO WG` |
| 18 | `last_reviewed_date` | No | Last review (YYYY-MM-DD) | `2026-01-19` |

## Initial Entries

The current dictionary version is **v0.1.0** and contains:

| Dimension | Name | Active Codes | Deprecated | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FS | Functional Scope | 6 | 0 | 6 |
| UC | Use Case Class | 30 | 0 | 30 |
| DT | Data Type | 10 | 0 | 10 |
| CH | Channel | 8 | 0 | 8 |
| IM | Integration Mode | 7 | 0 | 7 |
| RS | Risk Surface | 8 | 0 | 8 |
| OB | Outcome / Benefit | 7 | 0 | 7 |
| LG | Log/Event Type | 15 | 0 | 15 |
| **Total** | | **91** | **0** | **91** |

!!! note "Complete Code Listings"
    The complete list of 91 codes is available in the generated CSV artifacts. This documentation page provides column definitions and usage guidance. For detailed code definitions:

    - **Download**: See [Releases](../../../releases/) for per-language CSV files
    - **Per-language CSV**: `artifacts/taxonomy/current/{lang}/taxonomy_dictionary.csv`
    - **Legacy EN/JA mixed CSV**: `source_pack/03_taxonomy/legacy/taxonomy_dictionary_v0.1.csv` (frozen, for backward compatibility only)

## Update Policy

### Adding New Codes

1. Assign the next available number within the dimension (e.g., `UC-031` after `UC-030`)
2. Set `status` to `active`
3. Set `introduced_in` to the current version
4. Set `backward_compatible` to `true`
5. Provide label and definition (add translations to language packs)

### Modifying Existing Codes

| --- | --- | --- |
| Definition clarification | Yes | PATCH |
| Scope notes update | Yes | PATCH |
| Label change (meaning preserved) | Yes | MINOR |
| Meaning change | No | Create new code instead |

### Deprecating Codes

1. Set `status` to `deprecated`
2. Set `deprecated_in` to current version
3. Set `replaced_by` to the new code (if applicable)
4. Code remains functional for backward compatibility
5. Document the reason in scope_notes

### Removing Codes

1. Deprecate for at least one MINOR version first
2. Set `status` to `removed`
3. Set `removed_in` to current MAJOR version
4. Code is no longer valid for new evidence

### Compatibility Policy

| Action | Version Impact | Backward Compatible |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add new code | MINOR | Yes |
| Deprecate code | MINOR | Yes |
| Clarify definition | PATCH | Yes |
| Remove code | MAJOR | No |
| Change code meaning | Not allowed | - |

## How to Use

### In Evidence Templates

Each Evidence Pack template includes an 8-dimension codes table:

```markdown
## AIMO Codes (8 Dimensions)

| Dimension | Code(s) | Label |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **FS** | `FS-001` | End-user Productivity |
| **UC** | `UC-001`, `UC-002` | General Q&A, Summarization |
| **DT** | `DT-002`, `DT-004` | Internal, Personal Data |
| **CH** | `CH-001` | Web UI |
| **IM** | `IM-002` | SaaS Integrated |
| **RS** | `RS-001`, `RS-003` | Data Leakage, Compliance Breach |
| **OB** | `OB-001` | Efficiency |
| **LG** | `LG-001`, `LG-002` | Request Record, Review/Approval Record |
```

### In Validator

The validator checks:

1. All codes referenced in evidence exist in the dictionary
2. Code format matches the expected pattern (`PREFIX-###`)
3. Deprecated codes trigger warnings
4. Removed codes are rejected

### Extension Guidelines

Organizations MAY extend the dictionary with custom codes:

**Extension Prefix:**

```
X-<ORG>-<DIM>-<TOKEN>
```

Example: `X-ACME-UC-901` for ACME Corporation's custom use case code.

**Extension Rules:**

1. Custom codes MUST NOT conflict with standard codes
2. Custom codes SHOULD be documented in a local extension dictionary
3. When exchanging evidence with external parties, use only standard codes

## Downloads

# Evidence Pack Template (EP)

This section defines the Evidence Pack templates and their usage. An Evidence Pack is a collection of documentation that demonstrates governance and compliance for an AI system.

## Namespace: Evidence Pack document types (EP) vs Taxonomy Log/Event Type (LG)

> **Important**: **EP-01..EP-07** identify *document types* (Evidence Pack file types). **LG-001, LG-002, …** in the [Taxonomy](../03-taxonomy/) identify *log/event types* (Request Record, Review/Approval, Exception, etc.). **EV-** is reserved for [Evidence artifact IDs](../04b-id-policy-namespace/) only. Use EP for pack structure and LG for lifecycle log/event classification.

## Key Principle: Index and Diff Management

What matters is not the content of individual submissions alone, but the **index** and **diff management** across evidence items.

An Evidence Pack serves as an index linking AI systems to their governance artifacts. The value lies in:

1. **Traceability**: Linking decisions, approvals, and changes across time
2. **Auditability**: Enabling auditors to navigate the evidence structure
3. **Maintainability**: Tracking what changed, when, and why

## MVP Evidence Set (EP-01 to EP-07)

The following seven **Evidence Pack document types** (EP) form the **minimum viable set** for demonstrating AI governance. Each is a document template; taxonomy **LG** codes (Request Record, Review/Approval, etc.) are used elsewhere in the bundle and in `codes.LG` to classify *log/event* evidence.

| ID | Document Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EP-01 | System Overview | Document the AI system and its purpose |
| EP-02 | Data Flow | Map data movement through the system |
| EP-03 | Inventory | Maintain catalog of AI assets |
| EP-04 | Risk & Impact Assessment | Assess and document risks |
| EP-05 | Controls & Approvals | Document controls and approval records |
| EP-06 | Logging & Monitoring | Define logging and monitoring setup |
| EP-07 | Incident & Exception | Track incidents and exceptions |

## Evidence Pack Manifest

Each Evidence Pack MUST include a manifest file containing:

### Mandatory Metadata

| Field | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pack_id` | Unique identifier (e.g., EP-EXAMPLE-001) | Yes |
| `pack_version` | SemVer version of the pack | Yes |
| `taxonomy_version` | Version of AIMO taxonomy used | Yes |
| `created_date` | Pack creation date | Yes |
| `last_updated` | Last update date | Yes |
| `owner` | Responsible party | Yes |

### AIMO Codes (8 Dimensions)

Each Evidence Pack MUST include codes from all 8 dimensions. The **LG** dimension lists *taxonomy* Log/Event Types (e.g. Request Record, Review/Approval) applicable to this pack—not document type codes. Document type is given by `evidence_files[].file_id` (EP-01..EP-07). See [ID Policy / Namespace](../04b-id-policy-namespace/).

```json
{
  "codes": {
    "FS": ["FS-001"],
    "UC": ["UC-001", "UC-002"],
    "DT": ["DT-002"],
    "CH": ["CH-001"],
    "IM": ["IM-001"],
    "RS": ["RS-001", "RS-003"],
    "OB": ["OB-001"],
    "LG": ["LG-001", "LG-002", "LG-008", "LG-009"]
  }
}
```

### Evidence Files List

Each entry identifies a document in the pack by **file_id** (EP-01..EP-07). Optional **ev_codes** may list taxonomy LG codes (LG-xxx) that the document supports.

```json
{
  "evidence_files": [
    {
      "file_id": "EP-01",
      "filename": "EP-01_system_overview.md",
      "title": "System Overview",
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Template Structure

Each evidence template includes:

1. **Mandatory Metadata Block** - pack_id, version, taxonomy_version, dates, owner
2. **AIMO Codes Table** - All 8 dimensions with applicable codes
3. **Content Sections** - Domain-specific documentation sections
4. **References** - Links to related evidence
5. **Revision History** - Change tracking

### Template Header Example

```markdown
# EP-01: System Overview

---

## Mandatory Metadata

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **pack_id** | `EP-EXAMPLE-001` |
| **pack_version** | `0.1.0` |
| **taxonomy_version** | `0.1.0` |
| **created_date** | `2026-01-31` |
| **last_updated** | `2026-01-31` |
| **owner** | `AI Governance Team` |

---

## AIMO Codes (8 Dimensions)

| Dimension | Code(s) | Label |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **FS** | `FS-001` | End-user Productivity |
| **UC** | `UC-001` | General Q&A |
| **DT** | `DT-002` | Internal |
| **CH** | `CH-001` | Web UI |
| **IM** | `IM-001` | Standalone |
| **RS** | `RS-001` | Data Leakage |
| **OB** | `OB-001` | Efficiency |
| **LG** | `LG-001`, `LG-002` | Request Record, Review/Approval Record |
```

## External Forms (official templates/checklists attached as-is)

Attach **official external templates and checklists** (EU, NIST, UK, Japan, etc.) as separate files. Do not alter their content; attach as-is, hash them, and reference them in the bundle.

| Slot | Suggested logical_id / attachment | Where to attach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **EU GPAI CoP** | Model Documentation Form | Add to `payload_index` with e.g. `logical_id`: `GPAI_MODEL_DOC_FORM`; store file in `payloads/`; record `sha256` in manifest. |
| **NIST GenAI** | GenAI profile artifacts (e.g. adaptation records, evaluation) | Add to payload_index; reference in coverage map. Profile: `coverage_map/profiles/nist_ai_600_1_genai.json`. |
| **UK ATRS / procurement** | ATRS record, procurement evaluation notes | Add to payload_index; reference in [Procurement & Disclosure Overlays](../../coverage-map/procurement-and-disclosure/). |
| **Japan** | JP government GenAI procurement checklist, AI Business Guidelines checklist | Add to payload_index with e.g. `logical_id`: `JP_PROCUREMENT_CHECKLIST`; reference in Procurement & Disclosure Overlays. |

**Guidance:** Store each external form as a file (PDF, DOC, CSV, etc.), compute SHA-256, and list it in the bundle `manifest.json` `payload_index` with a stable `logical_id`. Link to AIMO taxonomy codes or bundle objects in your coverage map or handoff index so auditors can trace between external forms and AIMO evidence.

## Audit Handoff Index

For **Audit-Ready** level, provide a **one-page index** that tells the auditor where to find each key artifact:

| Artifact | Where to find it | Hash (sha256) | Producer | Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Manifest | `manifest.json` (bundle root) | (in hash_chain or separate) | — | created_at |
| Root EV / Summary | e.g. `payloads/root.json` | payload_index entry | — | — |
| Request/Review/Exception | (list key records) | (object or payload ref) | (role/org) | (timestamp) |
| External forms | (list logical_ids and paths) | payload_index entry | — | — |

Fill in one row per key artifact. This supports audit handoff without implying certification or assurance.

## Downloads

### Templates

Evidence Pack templates are available in the repository. Use **file_id** EP-01..EP-07 in the manifest; filenames may be EP-01_... or legacy EV-01_... for backward compatibility.

- `source_pack/04_evidence_pack/templates/EV-01_system_overview.md` → file_id **EP-01**
- `source_pack/04_evidence_pack/templates/EV-02_data_flow.md` → file_id **EP-02**
- `source_pack/04_evidence_pack/templates/EV-03_inventory.md` → file_id **EP-03**
- `source_pack/04_evidence_pack/templates/EV-04_risk_impact.md` → file_id **EP-04**
- `source_pack/04_evidence_pack/templates/EV-05_controls_approvals.md` → file_id **EP-05**
- `source_pack/04_evidence_pack/templates/EV-06_logging_monitoring.md` → file_id **EP-06**
- `source_pack/04_evidence_pack/templates/EV-07_incident_exception.md` → file_id **EP-07**

### Schemas and Examples

- Schema: `source_pack/04_evidence_pack/schemas/evidence_pack_manifest.schema.json`
- Example: `source_pack/04_evidence_pack/examples/evidence_pack_manifest.example.json`

See [Releases](../../../releases/) for downloadable packages.

## Distribution Model

> **Note**: The primary distribution targets are **audit firms and system integrators** (template distributors), not individual enterprises.

The templates are designed to be:

1. Adopted by auditors and consultants as standard artifacts
2. Distributed to enterprises with source attribution preserved
3. Versioned alongside the AIMO Standard

Enterprises receive templates through their auditors, consultants, or internal governance teams who maintain the linkage to the standard version.

# Validator

The AIMO Validator ensures that Evidence Packs and related artifacts conform to the AIMO Standard schemas and requirements.

See also: [Human Oversight Protocol](../../../governance/human-oversight-protocol/) — responsibility boundary for machine vs. human review.

## What the Validator validates (required file set)

The Validator checks the **Evidence Bundle** structure and related artifacts. For a minimal submission, the following are required:

| Artifact | Purpose | Canonical location (per release) |
|----------|---------|-----------------------------------|
| **Evidence Pack Manifest** | Root manifest (`root.json` or equivalent) | Schemas: [evidence_pack_manifest.schema.json](https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/blob/main/schemas/jsonschema/evidence_pack_manifest.schema.json); release ZIP: `schemas/jsonschema/` |
| **Dictionary** | Taxonomy codes used in the manifest | [Evidence Bundle](../../../artifacts/evidence-bundle/) structure; [Dictionary](../05-dictionary/) spec |
| **Minimum Evidence Requirements** | Checklist for auditors and implementers | [Minimum Evidence Requirements](../../../artifacts/minimum-evidence/) |

The Validator does **not** guarantee legal or regulatory compliance; it checks structural conformance to the schemas and code system. For the full checklist of what evidence to include, see [Minimum Evidence Requirements](../../../artifacts/minimum-evidence/).

**Canonical URLs for a specific version**: Obtain schemas and the validator from the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/releases) for the version you are aligning with (e.g. `v0.0.3`). The release ZIP (`aimo-standard-artifacts.zip`) contains `schemas/jsonschema/`, templates, and validator rules.

## Validator in practice

For a 30-second quickstart (install, run, interpret output), see [Validator hub](../../../validator/).

## Validator MVP Requirements

The minimum viable validator MUST perform the following checks:

### 1. Required Field Validation

Check that all mandatory fields are present:

| Artifact | Required Fields |
| --- | --- |
| Evidence Pack Manifest | pack_id, pack_version, taxonomy_version, created_date, last_updated, codes, evidence_files |
| Codes Object | FS, UC, DT, CH, IM, RS, LG (OB optional) |
| Evidence File Entry | file_id (EP-01..EP-07), filename, title (ev_type / ev_codes optional) |

### 2. Dimension Code Validation

Check that each required dimension has at least one code:

| Dimension | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| FS (Functional Scope) | Exactly 1 code |
| UC (Use Case Class) | At least 1 code |
| DT (Data Type) | At least 1 code |
| CH (Channel) | At least 1 code |
| IM (Integration Mode) | Exactly 1 code |
| RS (Risk Surface) | At least 1 code |
| OB (Outcome / Benefit) | Optional (0 or more) |
| LG (Log/Event Type) | At least 1 code |

### 3. Dictionary Existence Check

Validate that all codes exist in the taxonomy dictionary:

- Load the taxonomy dictionary for the specified `taxonomy_version`
- Verify each code in the manifest exists in the dictionary
- Report invalid codes with their dimension and value

### 4. Code Format Validation

Check that all codes match the expected format:

```regex
^(FS|UC|DT|CH|IM|RS|OB|LG)-\d{3}$
```

### 5. Schema Validation

Validate against JSON Schemas:

| Schema | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `evidence_pack_manifest.schema.json` | Evidence Pack manifests |
| `taxonomy_pack.schema.json` | Taxonomy pack definitions |
| `changelog.schema.json` | Changelog entries |

## Validation Rules

### Rule: Required Dimensions

```yaml
rule_id: required_dimensions
description: All required dimensions must have at least one code
severity: error
check: |
  - FS: exactly 1
  - UC: at least 1
  - DT: at least 1
  - CH: at least 1
  - IM: exactly 1
  - RS: at least 1
  - LG: at least 1
```

### Rule: Valid Codes

```yaml
rule_id: valid_codes
description: All codes must exist in the taxonomy dictionary
severity: error
check: |
  For each code in manifest.codes:
    - Code exists in dictionary for specified taxonomy_version
    - Code status is 'active' (warn if 'deprecated')
```

### Rule: Code Format

```yaml
rule_id: code_format
description: All codes must match the standard format
severity: error
pattern: "^(FS|UC|DT|CH|IM|RS|OB|LG)-\\d{3}$"
```

### Rule: Version Format

```yaml
rule_id: version_format
description: Versions must be valid SemVer
severity: error
pattern: "^\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+$"
fields:
  - pack_version
  - taxonomy_version
```

## Error Output Format

Validation errors are reported in the following format:

```
<path>: <severity>: <message>
```

**Examples:**

```
codes.FS: error: Required dimension 'FS' has no codes
codes.UC[0]: error: Code 'UC-999' does not exist in dictionary v0.1.0
pack_version: error: Invalid version format 'v1.0' (expected SemVer)
codes.RS[1]: warning: Code 'RS-002' is deprecated in v0.2.0
```

## What Validator Does NOT Check

The validator focuses on structural conformance, not content quality:

| Aspect | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Content accuracy | Validator checks structure, not meaning |
| Evidence completeness | Templates are guides, not enforced formats |
| Cross-reference resolution | File existence not verified |
| Timestamp validity | ISO-8601 not strictly validated |
| ID uniqueness | Not currently enforced |
| Integrity hashes | Adopter responsibility |

## Audit report outputs (informative, v0.1.2)

From v0.1.2, the validator can emit **audit report** outputs intended for attachment to evidence packages (e.g. for auditors). These are **informative** only: they do not change normative bundle pre-checks or schema checks.

| Format | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| `--format audit-json` | Machine-readable report: `report_version`, `generated_at`, validator and AIMO standard version, bundle metadata, `summary` (passed, errors, warnings), and `results` (severity, check_id, message, path). Use `--output <path>` to write to a file. |
| `--format audit-html` | Human-readable HTML report with the same information; suitable for printing or saving as PDF via the browser. Use `--output <path>` to write to a file. |

These reports describe **evidence readiness and integrity checks** (manifest, hash chain, signatures, schema validation). They do not constitute assurance, compliance, or legal advice. Version bump to 0.1.2 is applied in a separate release step.

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation is provided in Python:

```
validator/src/validate.py
```

### Usage

```bash
python validator/src/validate.py <manifest.json>
```

### Example Output

```
Validating: evidence_pack_manifest.json
Taxonomy version: 0.1.0

Checking required dimensions...
  FS: OK (1 code)
  UC: OK (3 codes)
  DT: OK (1 code)
  CH: OK (1 code)
  IM: OK (1 code)
  RS: OK (3 codes)
  OB: OK (2 codes)
  LG: OK (7 codes)

Checking code validity...
  All codes valid.

Validation: PASSED
```

## Versioning Policy

Validator rules follow SemVer:

- **MAJOR**: Breaking rule changes (new required checks that fail existing valid packs)
- **MINOR**: New optional checks, warnings, or informational messages
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes that don't change validation outcomes

## Versioning Policy

AIMO Standard follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer):

### Version Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

| Change Type | Version Bump | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MAJOR** | X.0.0 | Breaking schema changes, code removal, required field changes |
| **MINOR** | 0.X.0 | New codes, new optional fields, new dimensions (optional) |
| **PATCH** | 0.0.X | Documentation fixes, definition clarifications, validator bug fixes |

### Breaking vs. Compatible Changes

**Breaking Changes (MAJOR):**

- Removal of codes (after deprecation period)
- Changes to required fields in schemas
- Structural changes that invalidate existing documents
- Changes to code format patterns

**Backward Compatible Changes (MINOR):**

- Adding new codes to existing dimensions
- Adding new optional fields to schemas
- Adding new optional dimensions
- Adding new evidence templates

**Non-breaking Changes (PATCH):**

- Documentation corrections
- Clarification of existing definitions
- Translation improvements
- Validator bug fixes

## Deprecation Policy

### Deprecation Process

1. **Mark as Deprecated**: Code or feature is marked with `status: deprecated` and `deprecated_in: X.Y.Z`
2. **Deprecation Period**: At least one MINOR version must pass before removal
3. **Provide Replacement**: If applicable, `replaced_by` indicates the replacement
4. **Remove in MAJOR**: Removal occurs in the next MAJOR version

### Example Lifecycle

```
v0.0.1: FS-007 introduced (status: active)
v0.1.0: FS-007 deprecated (status: deprecated, replaced_by: FS-008)
v0.2.0: FS-007 still available with deprecation warning
v1.0.0: FS-007 removed (status: removed)
```

### Using Deprecated Codes

- Deprecated codes remain valid for validation
- Validator SHOULD emit a warning for deprecated codes
- New implementations SHOULD use replacement codes
- Existing documents MAY continue using deprecated codes until migration

## Release Artifacts

Each official release includes:

| Artifact | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Versioned site snapshot | `https://standard.aimoaas.com/0.0.1/` |
| PDF specification | `trust_package.pdf` |
| Asset package (ZIP) | Schemas, templates, dictionary |
| Checksums | SHA-256 hashes for integrity |
| Changelog | This document |

## Change History

### Version 0.1.2 {#version-012}

**Summary:** PATCH release (non-breaking). Normalizes EU AI Act references in docs/SSOT (informative mapping only; not legal advice). Improves Annex IV sample bundle completeness (signatures, hashes, payload). Adds optional JNC schema and validator check. Adds validator audit report outputs (audit-json, audit-html). See repository [changelog/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/blob/main/changelog/CHANGELOG.md) for full entry.

#### Repair-deploy addendum (docs + mappings) — 2026-02-15

- Added ISO/IEC 42006 coverage map page.
- Expanded Conformance into AIMO Conformity Framework aligned to ISO 42001 (informative); levels Foundation, Operational, Audit-Ready.
- Added ISO 42001 certification readiness toolkit (artifact).
- Added EU AI Act timeline (02 Feb / 02 Aug 2025–2027), harmonised standards notes, and 2026 AI Office guidelines (informative).
- Added new profiles and schema enum additions (ISO_42006, EU_AI_ACT_HIGH_RISK, EU_GPAI_COP, NIST_AI_600_1, UK_ATRS, JP_GOV_GENAI_PROCUREMENT); no version bump.
- **No version bump:** repair-deploy updates the already released v0.1.2 snapshot.

### Version 0.1.1 {#version-011}

**Summary:** PATCH release. Optional signature metadata for verification, Coverage Map audit_questions, Normative/Informative and governance clarifications, v0.2 roadmap. See repository [changelog/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/blob/main/changelog/CHANGELOG.md) for full entry.

### Version 0.1.0 {#version-010}

**Summary:** Normative Evidence Bundle structure, ID namespace (EV/LG), Profiles, Validator. Breaking: EV→LG for taxonomy. See repository [changelog/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/blob/main/changelog/CHANGELOG.md) for full entry.

### Unreleased (namespace and normative fixes)

**Summary:** Resolves EV code collision, clarifies EV (index) vs Evidence Pack (payload), and hardens /dev against audit miscitation.

#### Changed

- **Evidence Pack document types (EP namespace):** Evidence Pack file types use **EP-01..EP-07** (document type). Taxonomy **LG-001, LG-002, …** are Log/Event types (Request Record, Review/Approval, etc.). **EV-** reserved for Evidence artifact IDs only. See [Evidence Pack Template](../06-ev-template/) and [ID Policy / Namespace](../04b-id-policy-namespace/). Schema: `evidence_files[].file_id` pattern is `^EP-\\d{2}$`; `ev_type` uses **LG-xxx**.
- **Normative relationship:** [Evidence Bundle](../../../artifacts/evidence-bundle/) now states normatively: EV records (JSON) are the index/ledger; Evidence Pack files are the payload; EV records SHOULD reference payload by evidence_file_ids (e.g. EP-01) and/or hashes; minimum submission set = EV JSON + Dictionary + Summary + Change Log + Evidence Pack.
- **/dev anti-miscitation:** Development preview pages show a red banner: "Development Preview — Not for audit citation. Use /latest/ or a versioned URL." Canonical for /dev/ pages points to /latest/; noindex remains in place.

### Version 0.0.1 (2026-02-02)

**Summary:** Initial release of AIMO Standard with 8-dimension code system, Evidence Pack templates, and comprehensive governance documentation.

#### Added

# Evidence Bundle root structure (v0.1)

This page defines the **normative** root layout and manifest for an Evidence Bundle. Validators MUST reject bundles that do not satisfy these requirements before any schema validation.

## v0.1 normative MUST (summary)

- **manifest.json** at bundle root is required.
- **object_index** and **payload_index**: each entry MUST include **sha256** (64 lowercase hex); paths MUST be relative and MUST NOT contain `../` or escape the bundle root.
- **signing.signatures** MUST be a non-empty array (empty array is invalid).
- Each signature entry MUST have: **path** under `signatures/` (path traversal forbidden), **targets** (array, at least one path), and at least one signature in the bundle MUST list **manifest.json** in **targets** (manifest signing is mandatory).
- **hash_chain**: v0.1 MUST include **algorithm**, **head**, **path** (under `hashes/`), and **covers** with at least **manifest.json** and **objects/index.json**.

Validators MUST enforce these before accepting a bundle. The JSON Schema and the reference validator implement the same rules.

## Root required structure (MUST)

At the bundle root, the following MUST be present:

| Item | Type | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| **manifest.json** | File | Bundle manifest (see below). Canonical descriptor for the bundle. |
| **objects/** | Directory | Enumerated objects (e.g. metadata, indexes). Listed in `manifest.json` `object_index`. |
| **payloads/** | Directory | Payload files (e.g. root EV JSON, Evidence Pack files). Listed in `manifest.json` `payload_index`. |
| **signatures/** | Directory | Digital signatures. v0.1 MUST contain at least one signature file that references the manifest (existence and target reference; cryptographic verification is a future extension). |
| **hashes/** | Directory | Hash chain or integrity records (as needed by `manifest.json` `hash_chain`). |

Implementers MUST NOT submit a bundle that omits any of these. The Validator MUST fail with a clear message when the root structure is incomplete.

## Integrity (normative) vs Custody (implementation)

- **Integrity** is **normative** in v0.1: the standard mandates that the bundle carries integrity metadata (manifest, sha256 for indexed files, signature presence for the manifest). Validators MUST check that:
  - Required directories and files exist.
  - `manifest.json` is present and valid (schema and pre-schema checks).
  - Every file listed in `object_index` and `payload_index` exists at the given path and its content matches the declared `sha256`.
  - `signatures/` contains at least one signature that targets the manifest (v0.1: existence and reference only; v0.1.1: verification metadata RECOMMENDED; v0.2 planned: cryptographic verification in scope).
- **Custody** (storage, access control, retention, WORM) is **implementation-defined**. The standard does not prescribe how custodians store or protect the bundle; it only requires that the package, when submitted, satisfies the Integrity requirements above.

## manifest.json (MUST fields)

The manifest MUST include at least:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **bundle_id** | string (UUID) | Unique identifier for this bundle. |
| **bundle_version** | string (SemVer) | Version of the bundle. |
| **created_at** | string (date-time) | Creation timestamp. |
| **scope_ref** | string | Scope reference (e.g. `SC-001`). Pattern `SC-*`. |
| **object_index** | array | List of objects: `id`, `type`, `path`, `sha256`. Paths MUST be relative, MUST NOT contain `../` or start with `/`, and MUST remain within the Evidence Bundle root (validators MUST reject paths that escape the bundle root). |
| **payload_index** | array | List of payloads: `logical_id`, `path`, `sha256`, `mime`, `size`. Same path rules as object_index (relative, no `../`, no leading `/`, within bundle root). |
| **hash_chain** | object | **Normative (v0.1):** MUST include `algorithm` (sha256 \| merkle), `head` (64 lowercase hex), `path` (relative path under `hashes/`; no `../`, no leading `/`), and `covers` (array, at least one element). v0.1 MUST include `manifest.json` and `objects/index.json` in `covers`. |
| **signing** | object | **Normative (v0.1):** MUST include `signatures` (array, at least one entry). Each entry MUST have: `signature_id` (e.g. SIG-... or UUID), `path` (relative under `signatures/`; no `../`, no leading `/`), `targets` (array, at least one path; v0.1 MUST include `manifest.json` in at least one signature's targets), `algorithm` (one of ed25519, rsa-pss, ecdsa, unspecified). `created_at` (date-time) is MAY. **Note:** Cryptographic verification of signatures is out of scope for v0.1; reference (which file and what it targets) is required. |

**v0.1.1 optional signature metadata (RECOMMENDED for third-party re-performance):**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **signer_identity** | string | Identity of the signer (e.g. PGP fingerprint, did:key). |
| **signed_at** | string (date-time) | When the signature was applied (ISO 8601). |
| **verification_command** | string | Example CLI command for an auditor to re-perform verification. |
| **canonicalization** | string | How the signed payload was canonicalized: `rfc8785_json`, `cbor`, or `unspecified`. |

Integrity and verification: **v0.1** — reference and existence only. **v0.1.1** — metadata for verification is RECOMMENDED. **v0.2** (planned) — cryptographic verification in scope.

- **sha256** values MUST be 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters.
- **path** MUST be a relative path; MUST NOT contain `../` or start with `/`; paths MUST stay within the Evidence Bundle root.
- The manifest MAY include an explicit self-reference (e.g. in `object_index` or a dedicated field) so that the manifest’s own integrity is covered; validators MUST accept a bundle where the manifest is either listed in an index or explicitly referenced by a signature.

See the JSON Schema: `schemas/jsonschema/evidence_bundle_manifest.schema.json`.

## Future extensions (informative)

- **Control/Requirement linkage**: A future version may add a standard way to link Evidence Bundle elements to Control or Requirement identifiers (e.g. for export to NIST OSCAL or similar audit automation formats). This is not required in v0.1 or v0.1.1.

# v0.2 roadmap (informative)

This page summarizes planned directions for a **future major version** (v0.2). It is **informative** only; the normative specification for any release is the standard and schemas for that version. Target timeline: 2026 Q4–2027.

## Planned themes

| Theme | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| **Audit object model (SSOT)** | Requirement, Control, Claim, Evidence, Test, Finding, Remediation, Approval, Scope, VersionChange as normative objects with fixed IDs and reference integrity. |
| **External framework bridge** | Output profiles for EU Annex IV, GPAI Form, ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF; machine-readable mapping and optional one-click export. |
| **Evidence-as-Code** | Normative integrity: signature verification, provenance (e.g. SLSA-style), reproducibility and change tracking. |
| **Test procedure library** | Standard test templates per control; alignment with ISAE 3000, SOC 2, ISO 19011. |
| **Operational lifecycle** | Event-driven process (Intake → Review → Exception → Renewal → Change → Decommission) with required logs and evidence. |
| **Industry / jurisdiction profiles** | Optional profiles by sector and jurisdiction. |
| **Justified non-compliance (JNC)** | Optional mechanism to record and justify intentional non-compliance (informative). |
| **OSCAL linkage** | Standard way to link Evidence Bundle to Control/Requirement for export to NIST OSCAL or similar. |

# Evidence Bundle Coverage Map (Template)

!!! info "Informative — recommended practice"
    This page defines a **recommended practice template** for a one-page Evidence Bundle Coverage Map. It is **not** a normative requirement of the standard. Use it to document what a bundle covers and does not cover for auditor handoff. References (e.g. to frameworks) are stable; adoption is at the implementer's discretion.

---

## 1. Scope

| Item | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Scope reference** | `scope_ref` from the bundle manifest (e.g. `SC-001`). Links this bundle to the declared scope. |
| **Bundle ID** | `bundle_id` (UUID) — unique identifier for this bundle. |
| **Bundle version** | `bundle_version` (SemVer) — version of the bundle. |
| **Period / snapshot** | Optional: time period or snapshot date this bundle represents (e.g. 2026-Q1, as-of 2026-02-03). |

---

## 2. Evidence types (EV / objects vs payloads)

| Category | Contents | v0.1 minimal example |
|----------|----------|------------------------|
| **object_index** | Enumerated objects (metadata, indexes). Each entry: `id`, `type`, `path`, `sha256`. | e.g. `objects/index.json` (index type). |
| **payload_index** | Payload files (root EV JSON, Evidence Pack files). Each entry: `logical_id`, `path`, `sha256`, `mime`, `size`. | e.g. `payloads/root.json` (root AIMO EV JSON). |
| **EV types** | Evidence records (in root or linked payloads) — request, review, exception, renewal, change log. | Aligned with [Evidence Pack Template](../../standard/current/06-ev-template/) and [Minimum Evidence Requirements](../minimum-evidence/). |

*Implementers may extend object_index and payload_index; paths MUST remain within the bundle root and satisfy the [Evidence Bundle root structure (v0.1)](../../standard/current/09-evidence-bundle-structure/).*

---

## 3. Controls mapping (reference only)

Mapping to external frameworks is **for reference only**; the standard does not mandate compliance with any specific regulation.

| Framework | Use in this bundle | Reference |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------|
| **ISO/IEC 42001** | Optional: document which AI MS themes this bundle supports. | [Coverage Map → ISO 42001](../../coverage-map/iso-42001/) |
| **EU AI Act** | Optional: high-level documentation/record-keeping alignment. | [Coverage Map → EU AI Act](../../coverage-map/eu-ai-act/) |
| **NIST AI RMF** | Optional: Govern, Map, Measure, Manage mapping. | [Coverage Map → NIST AI RMF](../../coverage-map/nist-ai-rmf/) |
| **EU GPAI CoP** | Optional: Model Documentation Form; attach in External Forms, reference by logical_id. | [Coverage Map → EU AI Act](../../coverage-map/eu-ai-act/); profile `eu_gp_ai_cop.json` |
| **NIST AI RMF / GenAI** | Optional: GenAI profile (AI 600-1) artifacts. | [Coverage Map → NIST AI RMF](../../coverage-map/nist-ai-rmf/); profile `nist_ai_600_1_genai.json` |
| **UK ATRS** | Optional: ATRS record, procurement evaluation. | [Procurement & Disclosure](../../coverage-map/procurement-and-disclosure/); profile `uk_atrs_procurement.json` |
| **JP Gov GenAI procurement** | Optional: JP procurement checklist, AI Business Guidelines. | [Procurement & Disclosure](../../coverage-map/procurement-and-disclosure/); profile `jp_gov_genai_procurement.json` |
| **ISMS (27001/27002)** | Optional: change management, access, logging, integrity. | [Coverage Map → ISMS](../../coverage-map/isms/) |

*Fill in “Use in this bundle” per submission; the standard does not require any specific control coverage.*

### External Forms and manifest reference

**External Forms** (official templates/checklists attached as-is) should be listed in the bundle **payload_index** with a stable `logical_id`, `path`, `sha256`, `mime`, and `size`. Auditors can then trace from the manifest to the file and verify the hash. See [EV Template — External Forms](../../standard/current/06-ev-template/#external-forms-official-templateschecklists-attached-as-is) and [EV Template — Audit Handoff Index](../../standard/current/06-ev-template/#audit-handoff-index).

---

## 4. Exclusions / assumptions

| Area | What this bundle does **not** cover (example rows — adjust per submission) |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Exclusions** | e.g. Systems or use cases out of scope; third-party components not evidenced; time period outside this bundle. |
| **Assumptions** | e.g. Dictionary/taxonomy version; validator/schema version used; custody and retention are implementation-defined. |
| **Limitations** | e.g. Signature verification is out of scope in v0.1; no legal interpretation of regulations. |

*Replace placeholder text with submission-specific exclusions and assumptions.*

---

## 5. Integrity proof summary (v0.1)

| Element | What is provided (v0.1 normative) |
|---------|----------------------------------|
| **manifest.json** | Present and schema-valid; includes `object_index`, `payload_index`, `hash_chain`, `signing`. |
| **sha256** | Every file in `object_index` and `payload_index` has a declared 64-char lowercase hex sha256; validator checks content match. |
| **Index existence** | All listed paths exist under the bundle root; no path traversal (`../` or leading `/`). |
| **Signature existence** | At least one signature file in `signatures/`; manifest references it via `signing.signatures[]` with `path` and `targets` (v0.1 MUST include `manifest.json` in targets). Cryptographic verification is out of scope for v0.1. |
| **Hash chain** | `hash_chain` in manifest: `algorithm`, `head` (64-char hex), `path` (file under `hashes/`), `covers` (v0.1 MUST include `manifest.json` and `objects/index.json`). File at `hash_chain.path` exists. |

*This table summarizes the integrity guarantees that the [Validator](../../validator/) checks for v0.1 bundles. Custody (storage, access control, retention) is implementation-defined.*

---

## Coverage Map (YAML) vs Profiles (JSON)

| Artifact | Status | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Coverage Map YAML** (`coverage_map/coverage_map.yaml` or similar) | **Informative** | High-level mapping themes between AIMO evidence/artifacts and external frameworks (ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, etc.) for explainability. It does not impose normative validation requirements. |
| **Profile JSONs** (`coverage_map/profiles/*.json`) | **Normative** | Conversion specifications validated against `schemas/jsonschema/aimo-profile.schema.json`. They define machine-readable mappings (e.g. which AIMO objects map to which framework clauses). The [Validator](../../validator/) runs `--validate-profiles` to ensure all official profile JSONs conform to the schema (profile_id PR-* pattern, target enum, target_version, mappings). |

### Official profiles (validator-validated)

Profile JSONs live in `coverage_map/profiles/` and are validated by the validator (`--validate-profiles`). Naming: file name `<target>_<purpose>.json`; each includes `target_version`.

| File | profile_id | target | target_version |
|------|------------|--------|----------------|
| `iso42001.json` | PR-ISO42001-v0.1 | ISO_42001 | 1.0 |
| `iso_42001_readiness.json` | PR-ISO42001-READINESS-v0.1 | ISO_42001 | 2023 |
| `nist_ai_rmf.json` | PR-NIST-AI-RMF-v0.1 | NIST_AI_RMF | 1.0 |
| `nist_ai_600_1_genai.json` | PR-NIST-AI-600-1-v0.1 | NIST_AI_600_1 | 1.0 |
| `eu_ai_act_annex_iv.json` | PR-EU-AI-ACT-ANNEX-IV-v0.1 | EU_AI_ACT_ANNEX_IV | Annex IV |
| `eu_ai_act_high_risk.json` | PR-EU-AI-ACT-HIGH-RISK-v0.1 | EU_AI_ACT_HIGH_RISK | 2024/1689 |
| `eu_gp_ai_cop.json` | PR-EU-GPAI-COP-v0.1 | EU_GPAI_COP | current |
| `uk_atrs_procurement.json` | PR-UK-ATRS-v0.1 | UK_ATRS | current |
| `jp_gov_genai_procurement.json` | PR-JP-GOV-GENAI-PROCUREMENT-v0.1 | JP_GOV_GENAI_PROCUREMENT | current |

### Profile update policy

- **EU AI Act refs (0.1.2)**: Article references for the EU AI Act in the coverage map and docs were aligned to Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 for consistent evidence readiness; informative only, not legal advice.
- **ISO 42001 / NIST AI RMF**: New versions of the target framework may be added as new profile files or new `target_version` values in a future standard version; v0.1 profiles remain frozen for the v0.1 release.
- **EU AI Act Annex IV**: Annex IV and related articles may be updated by regulators; profile mappings may be updated via **PATCH** (e.g. 0.1.x) to follow wording or clause changes while keeping the same profile_id for continuity. Implementers should align with the version referenced in the profile’s `target_version` and release notes.

# Evidence Bundle

An **Evidence Bundle** is an audit package: a structured set of artifacts that supports explainability and traceability for AI governance. It is not a product feature but a deliverable format for auditors and compliance.

## Root required structure (normative)

The **root layout** of an Evidence Bundle is defined normatively in [Evidence Bundle root structure (v0.1)](../../standard/current/09-evidence-bundle-structure/). At the bundle root the following MUST be present:

- **manifest.json** — bundle manifest (bundle_id, bundle_version, object_index, payload_index, hash_chain, signing).
- **objects/** — directory for enumerated objects (listed in manifest).
- **payloads/** — directory for payload files (e.g. root EV JSON, Evidence Pack files).
- **signatures/** — directory for digital signatures; v0.1 MUST contain at least one signature that references the manifest (existence and target; verification is a future extension).
- **hashes/** — directory for hash chain or integrity records as required by the manifest.

**Integrity** (manifest, sha256 for indexed files, signature presence) is **normative** and enforced by the [Validator](../../validator/). **Custody** (storage, access control, retention) is **implementation-defined** and not specified by the standard.

## Bundle structure and naming

- **Bundle root naming**: use a consistent pattern such as `{org}_{system}_{period}_{version}` (e.g. `acme_ai-usage_2026-Q1_v1`).
- **Required files**: at least one Evidence (EV) set aligned with the [Evidence Pack Template (EP)](../../standard/current/06-ev-template/), a [Dictionary](../../standard/current/05-dictionary/), a short **Summary** (executive summary of the bundle), and a **Change Log** (or reference to it) for changes to the bundle or its contents.
- **Optional attachments**: logs, review records, exception approvals, renewal records; keep naming consistent and referrable from the main EV/Dictionary.

## Table of contents (TOC)

| Section | Artifact | Required? | Purpose | Minimum fields | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Evidence | EV records (JSON/array) | Yes | Record of what happened; link to request/review/exception/renewal | id, timestamp, source, summary; optional lifecycle refs | [Validator](../../validator/), aimo-ev.schema.json |
| Dictionary | dictionary.json | Yes | Keys/labels/descriptions for codes and dimensions | entries (key, label, description) | aimo-dictionary.schema.json |
| Summary | summary (doc or field) | Yes | One-page overview for auditors | scope, period, key decisions, exceptions | — |
| Change log | change_log or reference | Yes | Audit trail of bundle/content changes | id, timestamp, actor, change description, references | — |
| Request | request record(s) | If applicable | Application/request for use | id, timestamp, actor/role, scope, rationale | — |
| Review/Approval | review record(s) | If applicable | Review and approval outcome | id, timestamp, actor/role, decision, references | — |
| Exception | exception record(s) | If applicable | Exception with compensating controls and expiry | id, timestamp, scope, expiry, compensating controls, renewal ref | — |
| Renewal | renewal record(s) | If applicable | Re-evaluation and renewal | id, timestamp, actor/role, decision, references to prior exception/EV | — |

## Normative relationship: EV records (index) and Evidence Pack (payload)

To avoid double-build and audit ambiguity, the following is **normative**:

1. **EV records (JSON)** are the **index/ledger**: machine-verifiable traceability. They record what happened (request, review, exception, renewal, change) and MUST carry stable IDs and cross-references.
2. **Evidence Pack files** (EP-01..EP-07 documents and manifest) are the **payload**: the human- and tool-readable evidence that the index points to.
3. **Linkage**: EV records SHOULD reference payload via `evidence_file_ids` (e.g. EP-01, EP-02) and/or cryptographic hashes. The [Validator](../../validator/) checks referential integrity when these references are present (e.g. every referenced file_id exists in the Evidence Pack manifest and optional hash matches).
4. **Minimum submission set** for audit: **EV JSON** (root/records) + **Dictionary** + **Summary** + **Change Log** + **Evidence Pack** (manifest + files, e.g. as a zip). All of these together form the conformance surface.

Implementers maintain a single source of truth: the EV index references the pack; the pack does not redefine the meaning of taxonomy EV codes (Request Record, Review/Approval, etc.). See [Evidence Pack Template](../../standard/current/06-ev-template/) for EP-01..EP-07 document types.

## Traceability

- **Stable IDs**: every record (EV, request, review, exception, renewal, change log entry) MUST have a stable, unique identifier.
- **Cross-references**: link Request → Review → Exception (if any) → Renewal and link EV items to these via reference fields (e.g. `request_id`, `review_id`, `exception_id`, `renewal_id`).
- **Linkage**: ensure auditors can follow a chain from an AI use (or exception) to the request, approval, any exception and its compensating controls and expiry, and renewal.

## How auditors use this

Auditors use the Evidence Bundle to verify that AI use is requested, reviewed, and approved; that exceptions are time-bound and have compensating controls and renewal; and that changes are logged. The TOC and traceability rules let them locate required artifacts and follow IDs and references across request, review, exception, renewal, and EV records. The Summary gives a quick overview; the Change Log supports change control and accountability.

See [Minimum Evidence Requirements](../minimum-evidence/) for MUST-level fields and lifecycle groups.

## Operational guidance

!!! info "Integrity (normative) vs Custody (implementation)"
    - **Integrity** is normative in v0.1: the bundle MUST have manifest.json, object_index/payload_index with sha256, and at least one signature in signatures/ that references the manifest. The [Validator](../../validator/) rejects bundles that do not satisfy these requirements.
    - **Custody** (access control, retention, WORM) is implementation-defined. Adopters should document access roles, retention policy, and audit trail; see [Minimum Evidence Requirements > Integrity & Access](../minimum-evidence/#6-integrity-access).

## Audit journey

From this page, the typical audit journey continues:

1. **Next**: [Minimum Evidence Requirements](../minimum-evidence/) — MUST-level checklist by lifecycle
2. **One-page summary**: [Evidence Bundle Coverage Map (template)](../evidence-bundle-coverage-map/) — scope, evidence types, controls mapping, exclusions, integrity (informative)
3. **Then**: [Coverage Map](../../coverage-map/) — mapping to external frameworks
4. **Validate**: [Validator](../../validator/) — run structural checks
5. **Download**: [Releases](../../releases/) — get release assets and verify checksums

# ISO/IEC 42001 Certification Readiness Toolkit

This page is a **practical, adoption-oriented** guide to producing **audit-ready evidence** aligned to ISO/IEC 42001 using AIMO artifacts. It **supports readiness**; it does **not** confer certification. Certification decisions remain with **accredited certification bodies**.

## Goal

Produce a structured, validator-checked Evidence Bundle that supports ISO/IEC 42001–type controls (context, leadership, planning, support, operation, performance evaluation, improvement) so that auditors can efficiently locate and verify evidence.

## 5-step workflow

| Step | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **1. Establish scope and AI inventory** | Define scope (scope_ref); classify AI systems using the [taxonomy](../../standard/current/03-taxonomy/) and [dictionary](../../standard/current/05-dictionary/). |
| **2. Set management-system artifacts** | Create or reference policies, roles, and PDCA-aligned artifacts. Use [AIMO-MS / AIMO-Controls](../../conformance/) as a structure; reference [Evidence Pack Template](../../standard/current/06-ev-template/) (EP-01..EP-07). |
| **3. Produce Evidence Bundle + minimum evidence** | Build manifest, object_index, payload_index, hash_chain, signing per [Evidence Bundle structure](../../standard/current/09-evidence-bundle-structure/). Include request, review, exception, renewal, change_log per [Minimum Evidence Requirements](minimum-evidence.md). |
| **4. Run validator + checksums + change control** | Run `python validator/src/validate.py <bundle_path> --validate-profiles`. Record validator version and output. Generate SHA-256 checksums; maintain change log entries that reference impacted objects. |
| **5. Prepare audit pack** | Package the bundle (zip or equivalent); provide checksums. Optionally attach [audit report output](../../standard/current/07-validator/) (audit-json / audit-html). Use versioned URLs (e.g. `/0.1.2/`) when citing the standard. For Audit-Ready level, add [Audit Handoff Index](../../standard/current/06-ev-template/#audit-handoff-index) and [External Forms](../../standard/current/06-ev-template/#external-forms-official-templateschecklists-attached-as-is) section. |

## Checklist: ISO 42001 clause family → AIMO artifacts → evidence outputs

| ISO 42001 clause family | AIMO artifacts | Evidence outputs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Context (4.1) | Summary, Dictionary, scope_ref | manifest scope_ref; Summary; Dictionary |
| Leadership / Policy (5.x) | Summary, review, dictionary | Review records; policy references |
| Planning (6.x) | request, review, exception, EV, Dictionary | Request/approval; risk/objectives in EV or Dictionary |
| Support (7.x) | Summary, review, EV, change_log | Documentation; competence/awareness evidence |
| Operation (8.x) | EV, request, review, exception | Operational controls; applicability |
| Performance evaluation (9.x) | EV, change_log, review, renewal | Monitoring; internal audit; management review |
| Improvement (10.x) | exception, renewal, change_log | Corrective action; continual improvement |

See [Coverage Map — ISO/IEC 42001](../../coverage-map/iso-42001/) and [ISO/IEC 42006](https://www.iso.org/standard/42006) for audit-body expectations.

## Safe language

- **Use:** "We use AIMO artifacts to support ISO/IEC 42001 readiness; certification decisions remain with accredited certification bodies."
- **Do not use:** "ISO 42001 certified by AIMO" or "AIMO certifies compliance."

Official standard (primary source): [ISO/IEC 42001:2023](https://www.iso.org/standard/42001) (ISO). This toolkit aligns with [Conformance](../../conformance/) and [Responsibility Boundary](../../governance/responsibility-boundary/) — AIMO does not certify or guarantee compliance.

# Justified Non-Compliance (JNC) — optional (v0.1.2)

This page is **informative**. The AIMO Standard **does not** require a Justified Non-Compliance (JNC) payload. As of **v0.1.2**, JNC is introduced as an **optional** mechanism: if an adopter submits a JNC payload within an Evidence Bundle, it **must** conform to the schema and is machine-validated. JNC is **not mandatory** in v0.1.2.

**Disclaimer:** This mechanism is for documentation and audit support only. It is **not legal advice** and does **not** constitute assurance or a guarantee of compliance with any regulation.

## Purpose

In practice, an organization may decide not to implement a specific control or evidence item (e.g. "Phase 1 does not include a model monitoring dashboard"). Auditors may ask: "Why is this not implemented, and what is the risk?" A **Justified Non-Compliance (JNC)** payload allows such decisions to be recorded in a structured, auditable way within the Evidence Bundle, alongside other payloads.

## v0.1.2 optional payload

- **Not required:** Bundles without JNC are valid. Validators do not require a JNC payload.
- **If present:** The JNC file must be listed in the bundle `manifest.json` `payload_index` and must conform to the JNC schema. The validator will run schema validation when it detects a JNC payload.

### Recommended placement

| Item | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Path in bundle | `payloads/jnc.json` |
| `logical_id` in payload_index | `JNC`, `jnc`, or `JUSTIFIED_NON_COMPLIANCE` (validator accepts any of these, case-insensitive) |
| MIME | `application/json` |

### Schema

The normative schema for the JNC payload is:

- **Schema file:** [schemas/jsonschema/aimo-jnc.schema.json](https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/blob/main/schemas/jsonschema/aimo-jnc.schema.json)

It defines a `version` (e.g. `0.1.2`) and a `non_compliances` array. Each entry includes:

- `id`, `aimo_item_ref`, `title`, `rationale`
- `risk_assessment`: `likelihood`, `impact` (enum: low/medium/high), `mitigation`
- `approver`: `name`, `role`, `approval_date` (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `review_schedule`: `quarterly` | `monthly` | `annually` | `ad-hoc`
- Optional: `sunset_condition`, `references`

See the schema and [examples/justified_non_compliance.json](https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/blob/main/examples/justified_non_compliance.json) for a minimal valid example.

## Alignment

A JNC structure aligns with:

- ISO 42001 Clause 6.1 (addressing risks and opportunities)
- NIST AI RMF GOVERN-1.6 (exception management)

## Status

- **v0.1 / v0.1.1**: No JNC schema or requirement. Adopters may document exceptions outside the bundle.
- **v0.1.2**: JNC is **optional**. If present in the Evidence Bundle, it is schema-validated. Not required for bundle validity.
- **v0.2 (planned)**: Further evolution may be described in the [v0.2 roadmap](../../standard/current/10-roadmap-v0.2/).

# Agent Activity Log Format

## Purpose

This schema defines a vendor-neutral format for logs that document **agentic AI privilege exercise, tool execution, and recursive operations**. It enables organizations to:

- Maintain an auditable record of autonomous agent actions
- Track "who did what with what authority" for compliance and incident investigation
- Support explainability for agentic AI operations in audit contexts

## Event model

The schema supports four event types that capture the agentic operation lifecycle:

| Event Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `agent_run` | Start or completion of an agent execution session |
| `tool_call` | Agent invoking a tool or external action |
| `tool_result` | Result returned from a tool invocation |
| `escalation` | Agent requesting human intervention or elevated privileges |

## Required fields (MUST)

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `event_time` | string (ISO8601) | Timestamp of the event | `2026-01-15T09:30:00Z` |
| `agent_id` | string | Identifier of the agent | `agent-coding-assistant-v2` |
| `agent_version` | string | Version of the agent | `2.1.0` |
| `run_id` | string | Unique identifier for this run/session | `run-20260115-abc123` |
| `event_type` | string | Type of event | `agent_run`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `escalation` |
| `actor_id` | string | Initiating user or service | `user@example.com` |
| `tool_name` | string | Name of the tool invoked | `file_write`, `api_call`, `shell_exec` |
| `tool_action` | string | Action performed by the tool | `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `execute` |
| `tool_target` | string | Target of the action | `/path/to/file`, `https://api.example.com` |
| `auth_context` | string | Permission/role summary | `role:developer, scope:project-x` |
| `input_ref` | string | Hash or URI to input (not the content itself) | `sha256:def456...` |
| `output_ref` | string | Hash or URI to output (not the content itself) | `sha256:ghi789...` |
| `decision` | string | Policy decision applied | `allow`, `block`, `needs_review`, `unknown` |
| `evidence_ref` | string | Reference to related evidence | `urn:evidence:...` |

## Optional fields (SHOULD/MAY)

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `recursion_depth` | number | Current recursion depth for nested agent calls |
| `retry_count` | number | Number of retries for this action |
| `policy_id` | string | Policy that triggered the decision |
| `prompt_template_id` | string | Prompt template identifier |
| `model` | string | Model used for this action |
| `latency_ms` | number | Latency in milliseconds |
| `cost_estimate` | number | Estimated cost of this action |
| `error_code` | string | Error code if the action failed |

## Safety notes

!!! warning "Agentic risk assumptions"
    When logging agentic AI activity, assume the following risks:

    - **Prompt injection**: Malicious inputs may attempt to manipulate agent behavior
    - **Over-privilege**: Agents may have broader permissions than intended for a specific task
    - **Recursive loops**: Agents may enter unintended recursive execution patterns
    - **Confused deputy**: Agents may be tricked into acting on behalf of unauthorized parties

    The schema is designed to capture "who did what with what authority" to support post-incident analysis and audit explanations. It does not prevent these risks; organizations must implement appropriate guardrails.

!!! warning "Data handling"
    - **Do not embed** secrets, credentials, or sensitive content in `input_ref` or `output_ref`.
    - Use hash references or secure URIs to separately stored content.
    - Apply appropriate access controls and retention policies.

# Log Schemas

## What this is

This section defines **normalized log formats** for evidence that can be included in an Evidence Bundle. These schemas provide a vendor-neutral structure for logs related to AI usage monitoring and agentic operations.

## When to use

- **Shadow AI visibility**: Documenting detection, inventory, and remediation of unapproved AI usage.
- **Agentic operation audits**: Explaining autonomous agent privilege exercise, tool execution, and recursive operations.
- **Incident reproducibility**: Providing structured evidence for incident investigation and root cause analysis.

## What it is NOT

!!! warning "Important"
    These schemas define **log formats for evidence submission**. They do NOT:

    - Automatically collect logs from your systems
    - Provide log aggregation or monitoring tools
    - Guarantee compliance with any regulation or standard
    - Replace vendor-specific logging implementations

    Organizations must implement their own log collection pipelines and normalize logs to these schemas for evidence submission.

# Minimum Evidence Requirements

This page is the **Minimum Evidence Requirements** checklist for auditors and implementers. It defines the minimum evidence requirements as a MUST-level checklist, grouped by lifecycle. It supports explainability and evidence readiness; it does not provide legal advice or guarantee compliance.

Use this page together with [Evidence Bundle](../evidence-bundle/) and the [Validator](../../standard/current/07-validator/) when preparing or reviewing submissions.

## 1) Request

- **MUST fields**: identifier, timestamp(s), actor/role, scope (what is requested), rationale (why).
- **MUST linkages**: request id referenced by review and by EV items that record the use.
- **What it proves**: that use was requested and scoped before approval and use.

## 2) Review / Approval

- **MUST fields**: identifier, timestamp(s), actor/role, decision (approved/rejected/conditional), scope, rationale, reference to request.
- **MUST linkages**: review id referenced by EV and by any exception or renewal that follows.
- **What it proves**: that a defined review and approval occurred before use (or exception).

## 3) Exception

- **MUST fields**: identifier, timestamp(s), scope, expiry (or deadline), compensating controls, rationale, reference to review/request.
- **MUST linkages**: exception → compensating controls; exception → expiry; exception → renewal (when re-evaluation is due).
- **What it proves**: that deviations are time-bound, have compensating controls, and are linked to renewal.

## 4) Renewal / Re-evaluation

- **MUST fields**: identifier, timestamp(s), actor/role, decision (renewed/revoked/conditional), references to prior exception/request/review/EV.
- **MUST linkages**: renewal references the exception or approval being renewed; EV items can reference renewal id.
- **What it proves**: that exceptions and approvals are re-evaluated and renewed or revoked on a defined basis.

## 5) Change Log

- **MUST fields**: identifier, timestamp, actor/role, change description, references (e.g. to EV, request, review, exception, renewal affected).
- **MUST linkages**: change log entries reference the artifacts they modify or that trigger the change.
- **What it proves**: that changes to the bundle or its contents are recorded and traceable.

## 6) Integrity & Access

Evidence integrity and access control are essential for audit reliance. While AIMO does not prescribe specific technical controls, adopters should document how these expectations are met.

### Access control guidance

| Aspect | Guidance |
| --- | --- |
| **Role-based access** | Define roles (e.g., evidence creator, reviewer, auditor, admin) and document who can create, read, update, or delete evidence. |
| **Least privilege** | Grant minimum necessary access; restrict write access to authorized personnel. |
| **Access logging** | Log access events (who, when, what) for audit trail purposes. |
| **Separation of duties** | Where practical, separate evidence creation from approval roles. |

### Retention guidance

| Aspect | Guidance |
| --- | --- |
| **Retention period** | Define and document retention periods based on regulatory requirements and organizational policy (e.g., 5-7 years for financial audits). |
| **Retention schedule** | Maintain a schedule showing what evidence is retained, for how long, and when it can be disposed. |
| **Legal hold** | Support legal hold processes that suspend normal retention/deletion for litigation or investigation. |

### Immutability options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Cryptographic hashing** | Generate SHA-256 (or stronger) hashes for evidence files; store hashes separately for verification. |
| **WORM storage** | Use Write-Once-Read-Many storage for evidence archives to prevent modification. |
| **Append-only logs** | Use append-only audit logs for change tracking. |
| **Digital signatures** | Sign evidence bundles to prove authorship and detect tampering. |

### Audit trail expectations

| Element | What to document |
| --- | --- |
| **Change log** | Record who changed what, when, and why (see Change Log lifecycle group). |
| **Access log** | Record who accessed evidence, when, and for what purpose. |
| **System logs** | Retain relevant system logs (authentication, authorization) that support evidence integrity claims. |
| **Verification records** | Document periodic integrity verification (hash checks, audit reviews). |

### What it proves

- **Evidence is preserved**: integrity mechanisms (hashing, WORM, signatures) demonstrate that evidence has not been tampered with.
- **Access is controlled**: access logs and role definitions show who had access and that least privilege was applied.
- **Audit reliance is supported**: together, these elements give auditors confidence in the reliability of evidence.

### Recommended operational profiles

Choose a profile based on your risk tolerance and regulatory requirements. These are recommendations, not mandates.

| Aspect | Lightweight | Standard | Strict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Use case** | Internal pilots, low-risk AI | Production systems, moderate risk | Regulated industries, high-risk AI |
| **Retention period** | 1-2 years | 5-7 years | 7-10+ years or regulatory minimum |
| **Immutability** | SHA-256 hashes | SHA-256 + append-only logs | WORM storage + digital signatures |
| **Access control** | Role-based (basic) | Role-based + access logging | Separation of duties + full audit trail |
| **Audit trail** | Change log only | Change log + access log | Full system logs + periodic verification |
| **Verification frequency** | On-demand | Quarterly | Monthly or continuous |
| **Validator usage** | Optional | Required before submission | Required + automated CI checks |

!!! note "Retention periods are examples"
    Retention periods shown are illustrative. Organizations must determine retention based on applicable laws, contracts, industry requirements, and internal policies.

!!! tip "How to choose"
    - **Lightweight**: Suitable for experimentation, internal tools, or low-stakes applications where formal audits are unlikely.
    - **Standard**: Recommended for most production deployments where audits may occur but are not continuous.
    - **Strict**: Required for regulated industries (finance, healthcare, government) or AI systems with significant risk impact.

## Important note

This minimum set supports explainability and evidence readiness; it does not itself provide legal advice or guarantee compliance.

See [Evidence Bundle](../evidence-bundle/) for bundle structure and TOC; see [EV Template](../../standard/current/06-ev-template/) and schemas for field-level alignment.

See also: [Log Schemas](../log-schemas/) — normalized log formats for Shadow AI discovery and agent activity evidence.

## Regulatory overlays (informative)

The following **overlays** describe additional evidence often expected in specific regulatory or procurement contexts. They are **informative**; attach official templates/checklists as-is in the [External Forms section](../../standard/current/06-ev-template/#external-forms-official-templateschecklists-attached-as-is) of the EV Template and reference them by logical_id in the manifest.

| Overlay | Additional artifacts typically expected | Where to attach | Profile (optional) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **EU High-Risk** | Risk management, technical documentation (Annex IV), logging, human oversight, transparency (Art 50), incident reporting | payload_index; Evidence Bundle + Annex IV profile | `eu_ai_act_annex_iv.json`, `eu_ai_act_high_risk.json` |
| **EU GPAI CoP** | Model Documentation Form (transparency, copyright, safety & security) | External Forms; logical_id e.g. GPAI_MODEL_DOC_FORM | `eu_gp_ai_cop.json` |
| **NIST GenAI** | GenAI profile artifacts (model adaptation, evaluation, monitoring) | payload_index; change_log; External Forms / GenAI records | `nist_ai_600_1_genai.json` |
| **UK ATRS / procurement** | ATRS transparency record; accountability owner; procurement evaluation notes | External Forms; Summary, review | `uk_atrs_procurement.json` |
| **JP procurement** | Government GenAI procurement checklist; AI Business Guidelines checklist | External Forms; logical_id e.g. JP_PROCUREMENT_CHECKLIST | `jp_gov_genai_procurement.json` |

Profile file names follow the pattern `coverage_map/profiles/<target>_<purpose>.json`; each includes `target_version`. See [Coverage Map — Procurement & Disclosure](../../coverage-map/procurement-and-disclosure/) for UK and Japan; [EU AI Act](../../coverage-map/eu-ai-act/) and [NIST AI RMF](../../coverage-map/nist-ai-rmf/) for EU and NIST.

# Signature verification and Evidence-as-Code roadmap

This page is **informative**. It describes the planned evolution of Evidence Bundle signing and verification so that auditors can re-perform verification and so that integrity is cryptographically assured in a future version.

## Current state (v0.1)

- **Normative**: The bundle MUST have at least one signature entry that **references** the manifest (path under `signatures/`, `targets` including `manifest.json`). Validators check existence and reference only.
- **Out of scope**: Cryptographic verification of signature bytes; canonical form of the signed payload; signer identity; verification procedure.

## v0.1.1 — Verification metadata (RECOMMENDED)

v0.1.1 adds **optional** fields to each signature entry in `manifest.json` so that an auditor can understand how to re-perform verification in the future:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `signer_identity` | Who signed (e.g. PGP fingerprint, did:key). |
| `signed_at` | When the signature was applied (ISO 8601). |
| `verification_command` | Example CLI for an auditor (e.g. `aimo verify --pubkey ...`). |
| `canonicalization` | How the signed payload was produced (e.g. `rfc8785_json`, `cbor`). |

Implementers are **RECOMMENDED** to populate these so that v0.2 tooling can consume them. Validators in v0.1.1 **MAY** read and report these fields (e.g. in `--format json`) but do **not** perform cryptographic verification.

## v0.2 (planned) — Cryptographic verification and provenance

Planned for a future standard version (target 2026 Q4–2027):

1. **Verification in scope**: Validators MAY verify signature bytes against the declared algorithm and signer (e.g. public key). Failure of verification SHALL be reported.
2. **Provenance**: Alignment with SLSA-style provenance (builder, build type, materials) and/or in-toto layout may be specified so that the bundle can attest to how it was produced.
3. **Canonical form**: Normative rules for canonicalizing the signed payload (e.g. RFC 8785 JSON) so that verification is reproducible.

This roadmap is subject to change; the normative specification for each version is in the standard and schema for that version.

## Effective dates / applicability (high-level)

The following aligns with **EU official timeline** (AI Act Service Desk / Commission). It is **not legal advice** and does not guarantee accuracy. Always confirm with the **official legal text** and competent authorities.

| Phase | Date | What applies (high-level) |
|-------|------|----------------------------|
| Entry into force | August 2024 | Regulation in force; most substantive obligations not yet applicable. |
| General provisions & prohibitions | 02 Feb 2025 | Prohibited practices (unacceptable risk); certain AI literacy–related provisions. |
| GPAI rules + governance | 02 Aug 2025 | Rules on notified bodies, GPAI, governance, confidentiality, penalties; codes of practice. |
| Majority rules + Annex III high-risk + Art 50 transparency | 02 Aug 2026 | Full applicability for high-risk AI systems (Annex III), Article 50 transparency obligations. |
| High-risk embedded in regulated products | 02 Aug 2027 | High-risk AI systems embedded in products subject to EU product legislation. |

## Harmonised standards and presumption of conformity (Article 40)

When **harmonised standards** are published in the EU Official Journal under the AI Act, compliance with them can provide **presumption of conformity** with the corresponding requirements. The exact list and dates depend on standardisation work and OJ publication. AIMO mappings are informative and do not confer presumption of conformity. For current status, see the European Commission [AI Act standardisation](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-act-standardisation) page and **References** below.

## 2026 AI Office guidelines (implementation detail)

The European Commission has indicated that the **AI Office** will prepare **practical guidelines** during 2026, including on:

- High-risk classification
- Article 50 (transparency) implementation
- Incident reporting
- QMS-related elements

These guidelines are **update triggers** for AIMO profiles and coverage mappings: as they are published, adopters should align evidence and mappings with the latest official guidance. AIMO does not interpret or guarantee compliance with these guidelines.

!!! warning "Not legal advice"
    This page is for explanatory use only. You must verify applicability and dates against the official regulation and any implementing or amending acts. AIMO does not provide legal advice or guarantee compliance.

!!! note "Legal note / Informative mapping"
    This page is **informative** only. Legal interpretation should be based on the official regulation (EUR-Lex) and European Commission publications. AIMO does not provide legal advice or guarantee compliance.

# Coverage Map

## Important: Scope of this Coverage Map (No automatic compliance)

This Coverage Map provides **traceability** between AIMO Standard elements and major regulations/standards to accelerate audit explanations and evidence readiness.
**It does NOT automatically guarantee compliance** with any specific regulation or standard.
Applicable obligations vary by role (e.g., provider/deployer), use case, risk classification, transition timelines, and authoritative interpretations/certification schemes.

## How to use this map (traceability workflow)

1. Start from the external requirement (e.g., ISO/NIST/EU AI Act/ISMS) and find the mapped AIMO Standard elements.
2. Use the linked AIMO elements to identify required artifacts and minimum evidence requirements.
3. Validate completeness and consistency using the Validator, and apply human review where required (see [Human Oversight Protocol](../governance/human-oversight-protocol/)).

## Market adoption / certification trend

ISO/IEC 42001 certification is used as a **management-system layer** for AI governance. **AIMO does not certify.** Certification is performed by accredited certification bodies. AIMO supports **evidence readiness** and audit handoff: it provides an evidence structure and validator that can help adopters prepare for certification, not certification itself.

## From ISO/IEC 42001 to audit reality (ISO/IEC 42006)

**ISO/IEC 42006** (2025) specifies requirements for bodies that audit and certify AIMS against ISO/IEC 42001. It raises expectations for **evidence rigor**: documented controls, traceability, and consistency. AIMO’s Evidence Bundle, validator, and [Conformance levels](../../conformance/) (Foundation, Operational, Audit-Ready) help adopters produce structured, verifiable evidence that auditors can use. See [ISO/IEC 42006](iso-42006.md) for more.

# ISO/IEC 42006 mapping

> Traceability shortcuts: [Taxonomy](../../standard/current/03-taxonomy/) → [Minimum Evidence](../../artifacts/minimum-evidence/) → [Validator](../../validator/) → [Conformance](../../conformance/).

This page explains **ISO/IEC 42006** and how AIMO Standard supports adopters preparing for AIMS audits. It is informative only; it does not constitute certification or legal advice.

## What is ISO/IEC 42006?

**ISO/IEC 42006** specifies requirements for bodies that **audit and certify** AI management systems (AIMS) against **ISO/IEC 42001**. It builds on ISO/IEC 17021-1 (conformity assessment — requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of management systems). Published in **2025** (e.g. 2025-07), it formalizes competence and process expectations for certification bodies performing AIMS audits.

## Why it matters for AIMO adopters

Certification bodies applying ISO/IEC 42006 will expect **auditable evidence** of management-system controls: documented policies, roles, operational controls, monitoring, and improvement. AIMO helps structure that evidence into a consistent bundle (manifest, hashes, lifecycle records) and provides a validator for structural consistency. It does **not** replace the auditor’s judgment or the certification decision.

## AIMO support

| AIMO component | How it supports audit readiness |
| --- | --- |
| **Evidence Bundle + Validator** | Auditable structure: manifest, object_index, payload_index, hash_chain, signing. Validator checks presence and integrity; output can be attached to the bundle for auditors. |
| **Conformity levels** | Foundation / Operational / Audit-Ready describe evidence maturity (traceability, lifecycle trail, attestation, handoff index). They indicate readiness level, not certification. |
| **Coverage Map + Profiles** | Explainability and requirements traceability: mappings from AIMO artifacts to ISO 42001 clause families and, where applicable, to EU or other frameworks. |

See [Conformance](../../conformance/) for level definitions and [ISO/IEC 42001](iso-42001.md) for the underlying standard mapping.

# Methodology

> Note: This methodology supports traceability and evidence readiness. It does not guarantee compliance with any specific regulation/standard.

This page explains what the Coverage Map is and is not, how to use it in audit, and how it relates to the Evidence Bundle and Minimum Evidence Requirements.

## What the mapping is

- An **informative** mapping from external framework/regulation references (by topic) to AIMO evidence, Evidence Bundle TOC items, Minimum Evidence lifecycle groups, artifacts, and validator checks.
- A support tool for **explainability**: which AIMO evidence and artifacts can help demonstrate or explain alignment with a given external requirement (without claiming conformity).

## What the mapping is not

- **Not** a guarantee of compliance with any framework or regulation.
- **Not** legal advice or a substitute for verification against authoritative texts.
- **Not** exhaustive; it is a practical subset for audit-readiness and explainability.

## Audit questions (v0.1.1)

From v0.1.1, mappings may include **audit_questions**: example questions an auditor might ask when reviewing a given requirement. These are **for explanatory use only**. They do not constitute assurance, compliance guarantees, or an exhaustive audit program. Readers must verify against authoritative framework texts and apply professional judgment.

## How to use it in audit

Use the flow: **requirement → evidence → artifact → validation**.

1. **Requirement**: Identify the external framework reference and topic (e.g. ISO 42001 documentation, EU AI Act record-keeping).
2. **Evidence**: See which AIMO Evidence Bundle items and Minimum Evidence lifecycle groups (request, review, exception, renewal, change_log, integrity) support explainability for that requirement.
3. **Artifact**: Locate the artifacts (schemas, templates, examples) that implement or illustrate that evidence.
4. **Validation**: Use the validator and schema checks referenced to verify structural consistency.

Readers must verify against the authoritative text of each framework or regulation.

## Relationship to Evidence Bundle and Minimum Evidence Requirements

- **[Evidence Bundle](../../artifacts/evidence-bundle/)**: Defines the bundle structure, TOC, and traceability. Coverage Map rows reference Evidence Bundle sections (e.g. EV, Dictionary, Summary, change_log, request, review, exception, renewal).
- **[Minimum Evidence Requirements](../../artifacts/minimum-evidence/)**: Defines MUST-level lifecycle groups (request, review, exception, renewal, change_log, integrity). Coverage Map rows reference these groups in `minimum_evidence_refs`.

Use the Coverage Map to see which Evidence Bundle items and Minimum Evidence groups support explainability for a given external requirement.

## Non-overclaim statement

!!! warning "Important"
    The AIMO Standard supports **explainability and evidence readiness**. It does **not** provide legal advice, guarantee compliance, or certify conformity to any regulation or framework. Adopters must verify claims against authoritative texts and obtain professional advice as appropriate.

See [Responsibility Boundary](../../governance/responsibility-boundary/) for scope, assumptions, and adopter responsibilities.

# Procurement & Disclosure Overlays (UK, Japan)

This page describes **reference mappings** between AIMO evidence and selected **UK** and **Japan** procurement and disclosure frameworks. The goal is **burden reduction via reuse of AIMO evidence**: adopters can reuse evidence they already produce for AIMO to support procurement and disclosure requirements. It is **informative mapping only**; AIMO does not guarantee full compliance with government requirements. Verify against the official sources below.

## Primary sources

| --- | --- | --- |
| **UK ATRS** (AI Transparency Record) | Summary, review (accountability owner), evidence (model/system description), dictionary (risk considerations). Profile: `coverage_map/profiles/uk_atrs_procurement.json`. | Attach or reference ATRS-style transparency record in External Forms; link to bundle objects by logical_id. |
| **UK procurement guidance** | Request, review, exception; Evidence Bundle for supplier evaluation. | Use AIMO bundle to structure evidence for procurement evaluation; official UK guidance remains authoritative. |

## Japan: Government GenAI procurement and AI Business Guidelines (summary)

| Topic | AIMO evidence / mapping | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **JP government GenAI procurement checklist** | Attach checklist as External Form (e.g. payload: JP_PROCUREMENT_CHECKLIST); reference in manifest. Profile: `coverage_map/profiles/jp_gov_genai_procurement.json`. | Reference mapping only; AIMO does not replace official checklists. |
| **AI Business Guidelines** | Summary, dictionary; map checklist items to AIMO taxonomy codes where useful for traceability. | Use for explainability; verify against official Japanese guidance. |

## How to use

- **External Forms**: Attach UK or Japan official templates/checklists **as-is** (PDF, DOC, etc.), hash them, and list them in the Evidence Bundle [payload_index](../../standard/current/09-evidence-bundle-structure/) or in the [EV Template External Forms section](../../standard/current/06-ev-template/). Reference them by logical_id in the manifest and in coverage mappings.
- **Profiles**: The profiles listed above define optional machine-readable mappings; they do not impose legal or contractual obligations.

See [Conformance](../../conformance/) for levels and [Minimum Evidence — Regulatory overlays](../../artifacts/minimum-evidence/) for overlay summary.

# Conformance

!!! warning "Important: No certification, no assurance, no legal compliance claim"
    AIMO Standard defines an **evidence packaging and validation format**. It does not certify compliance with laws or standards.
    Audit and assurance opinions remain the responsibility of independent auditors and the adopting organization.
    **Appropriate claim:** "An Evidence Bundle was produced according to AIMO Standard v0.1.2 and structurally validated by the AIMO Validator."
    
    **Inappropriate claim:** "EU AI Act compliant", "ISO 42001 certified", "government approved".
    

AIMO Standard positions as an **assurance / audit handoff / continuous evidence layer**: it provides evidence packaging, validators, and traceability so that adopters and auditors can work with structured evidence. AIMO is **not** a certifier; certification and compliance decisions are made by accredited certification bodies, auditors, and the adopting organization.

These tiers are **internal evidence maturity levels** for packaging and traceability. They are **not** a certification, **not** an assurance opinion, and **not** legal or regulatory compliance.

## Compatibility claims (ISO/NIST/EU)

The following **informative mappings** link AIMO evidence and artifacts to external frameworks. They support explainability and audit handoff; they do **not** confer certification or guarantee compliance. Verify against the authoritative framework texts.

- [Coverage Map — ISO/IEC 42001](../coverage-map/iso-42001/) — mapping to ISO/IEC 42001 (AI management system)
- [Coverage Map — NIST AI RMF](../coverage-map/nist-ai-rmf/) — mapping to NIST AI Risk Management Framework
- [Coverage Map — EU AI Act](../coverage-map/eu-ai-act/) — mapping to EU AI Act themes (high-level; not legal advice)

Primary sources and claim language are documented on each coverage map page and in [Responsibility Boundary](../governance/responsibility-boundary/).

## Non-claims (what AIMO does NOT claim)

- AIMO does **not** certify conformity to ISO/IEC 42001, NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, or any other framework.
- AIMO does **not** guarantee regulatory or legal compliance.
- AIMO does **not** provide assurance opinions or legal advice.
- AIMO does **not** decide whether an organization meets external requirements; that is the responsibility of adopters, auditors, and certification bodies.

AIMO **does** provide: structured evidence format, validator, coverage mappings (informative), and materials to support audit handoff. See [Responsibility Boundary](../governance/responsibility-boundary/) for the full scope.

!!! note "Tier name alias"
    The top tier was previously referred to as "Gold" in informal discussions; the **official tier name is Audit-Ready**.

## AIMO Conformity Framework (AIMO-MS / AIMO-Controls / AIMO-Audit)

| Component | Description | Evidence expectations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AIMO-MS** | Management-system–oriented structure: policies, roles, PDCA-aligned artifacts that can support ISO/IEC 42001–type controls. | Request, review, exception, renewal, change log; Summary and Dictionary. |
| **AIMO-Controls** | Lifecycle and integrity controls: request→review→exception→renewal, hashing, signing (per [Evidence Bundle structure](../../standard/current/09-evidence-bundle-structure/)). | Object_index, payload_index, hash_chain, signing; lifecycle records. |
| **AIMO-Audit** | Readiness for audit handoff: validator pass, checksums, optional attestation and audit handoff index. | Validator output, bundle_id, producer identity, optional signature metadata and handoff index. |

Evidence expectations are described in [Minimum Evidence Requirements](../artifacts/minimum-evidence/) and [Evidence Bundle](../artifacts/evidence-bundle/).

## Conformity Levels (AIMO-only)

### Level 1 — Foundation

**Purpose:** Traceable baseline. Minimum set to make the bundle identifiable, integrity-verifiable, and validator-checked.

| Item | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **Required artifacts** | [Evidence Bundle](../artifacts/evidence-bundle/) structure (manifest.json, objects/, payload_index per spec); [Validator](../validator/) pass; link to [Minimum Evidence](../artifacts/minimum-evidence/). |
| **Typical audit questions** | What is in scope? Who produced the bundle? Can hashes be verified? |
| **Typical gaps** | Missing manifest metadata (bundle_id, created_at, producer); validator not run or not attached. |

### Level 2 — Operational

**Purpose:** Operational control evidence. Builds on Foundation with lifecycle trail and monitoring.

| Item | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **Required artifacts** | All Foundation MUST items; lifecycle control trail (request/approval, review, exception or “no exceptions”, renewal schedule); at least one monitoring artifact (incident log or periodic check or human oversight sampling); change log with integrity linkage; proof vs assurance boundary statement. |
| **Typical audit questions** | Who approved use? How are exceptions tracked? When was the last review? |
| **Typical gaps** | Review/approval not linked to request; no monitoring artifact; change log not referencing impacted objects. |

### Level 3 — Audit-Ready

**Purpose:** Audit handoff quality. Full attestation, reproducibility, and external-form slotting.

| Item | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **Required artifacts** | All Operational MUST items; at least one digital signature covering manifest (signer identity + algorithm); TSA or “no TSA” statement; reproducibility packet (exact validator command, expected outputs, environment metadata); External Forms section with official templates/checklists attached as-is and cross-referenced; bounded completeness statement; one-page audit handoff index (artifact → hash → producer → date). |
| **Typical audit questions** | How can an auditor re-run validation? Where are external checklists and how do they map to the bundle? |
| **Typical gaps** | Signature present but signer/algorithm not documented; no handoff index; external forms not hashed or not referenced in manifest. |

## Minimum Evidence by Level (summary)

| Level | MUST (summary) |
| --- | --- |
| **Foundation** | Bundle structure (manifest, object_index, payload_index); sha256 for referenced objects; bundle_id, created_at, producer; validator run + version; evidence dictionary baseline (system name, owner, purpose, data categories, lifecycle stage); access & retention statement (who, duration, storage type, tamper-evidence). SHOULD: minimal change log entry. |
| **Operational** | All Foundation MUST; lifecycle trail (request/approval, review, exception or “none”, renewal + last renewal); ≥1 monitoring artifact; change log entries reference impacted objects; explicit proof vs assurance boundary statement. |
| **Audit-Ready** | All Operational MUST; ≥1 signature over manifest (signer identity + algorithm); TSA or “no TSA”; reproducibility packet; External Forms listed and cross-referenced; bounded completeness statement; audit handoff index. |

Signature **presence** (at least one signature targeting the manifest) is required by the normative [Evidence Bundle structure](../../standard/current/09-evidence-bundle-structure/) for all bundles. **Audit-Ready** adds stricter **cryptographic attestation** (signer identity, algorithm, TSA statement, re-validation instructions) so a third party can re-perform checks.

## ISO/IEC 42001 Mapping (informative)

The following table shows how AIMO artifacts **support evidence for** typical ISO/IEC 42001 clause families. This is informative only; it does not imply certification or compliance.

| ISO/IEC 42001 clause family | AIMO artifacts that support evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Context of the organization | Summary, Dictionary, scope_ref |
| Leadership / Policy | Summary, review, dictionary |
| Planning (risks, objectives) | request, review, exception, EV, Dictionary |
| Support (resources, competence, documentation) | Summary, review, EV, change_log |
| Operation | EV, request, review, exception; operational controls |
| Performance evaluation (monitoring, internal audit, management review) | EV, change_log, review, renewal |
| Improvement | exception, renewal, change_log |

See [Coverage Map — ISO/IEC 42001](../coverage-map/iso-42001/) and [ISO 42001 Certification Readiness Toolkit](../artifacts/iso-42001-certification-readiness-toolkit/) for more detail.

## Claim language templates (anti-overclaim)

Use only claims that accurately describe what was done. Certification and legal compliance remain the responsibility of adopters and accredited bodies.

**Acceptable (examples)**

- "We are AIMO Conformant (Level 2) against AIMO Standard v0.1.2; this does not imply ISO certification or legal compliance."
- "We use AIMO artifacts to support ISO/IEC 42001 readiness; certification decisions remain with accredited certification bodies."
- "An Evidence Bundle was produced according to AIMO Standard v0.1.2 and structurally validated by the AIMO Validator."

**Unacceptable (examples)**

- "EU AI Act compliant" (AIMO does not certify regulatory compliance.)
- "ISO 42001 certified" (Certification is issued by accredited certification bodies, not AIMO.)
- "Government approved" (AIMO is not a government approval scheme.)

# Validator

This page is a hub for validation tooling and rules. The normative specification for the validator and its rules is in the Standard.

## Quickstart (30 seconds)

**1. Prerequisites**

```bash
pip install jsonschema   # if not already installed
```

**2. Run validation against a sample bundle**

```bash
# Single root JSON file
python validator/src/validate.py examples/evidence_bundle_minimal/root.json

# Evidence Bundle directory (v0.1 minimal: validates manifest, object_index, payload_index, signing, hash_chain)
python validator/src/validate.py examples/evidence_bundle_v01_minimal
```

**3. Read the report and fix errors/warnings**

Example output (success):

```
OK
```

Example output (failure):

```
Schema validation failed:
<root>: 'version' is a required property
<root>: 'dictionary' is a required property
<root>: 'evidence' is a required property
```

**Exit codes**: `0` = success, `1` = validation errors, `2` = usage error (e.g. missing path or options).

---

## Output formats (--format) and CI usage

| Option | Use case | Output |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `default` (omit) | Local inspection | Human-readable message (OK / error list) |
| `--format json` | CI and scripts | Machine-readable JSON (`valid`, `errors`, `warnings`, `path`, `profiles_valid`) |
| `--format sarif` | GitHub Code Scanning | SARIF 2.1.0 (ruleId, level, location, message). Use when feeding results into Code Scanning as a pre-submission gate. |
| `--format audit-json` | Audit attachment (machine-readable) | Validation report with metadata (validator version, AIMO standard version, bundle info, summary, results). Use with `--output <path>` to write to a file. |
| `--format audit-html` | Audit attachment (human-readable) | Same content as HTML for review or printing. You can export to PDF via the browser’s print dialog. Use with `--output <path>` to write to a file. |

**Example: validating the Evidence Bundle v0.1 minimal sample**

```bash
# Local success check
python validator/src/validate.py examples/evidence_bundle_v01_minimal

# Get result as JSON (for CI parsing)
python validator/src/validate.py examples/evidence_bundle_v01_minimal --validate-profiles --format json

# Write SARIF to a file (for Code Scanning upload)
python validator/src/validate.py examples/evidence_bundle_v01_minimal --validate-profiles --format sarif > dist/validator.sarif
```

### Audit report output

For audit attachment, use **audit-json** (machine-readable) or **audit-html** (human-readable, printable). These outputs summarize evidence readiness and integrity checks (bundle manifest, hash chain, signatures, schema validation). They do **not** constitute legal or compliance advice.

- **`--format audit-json`** — JSON report with `report_version`, `generated_at`, `validator`, `aimo_standard`, `bundle`, `summary`, and `results`. Suitable for tooling and archiving.
- **`--format audit-html`** — HTML report with the same information; you can print or save as PDF from your browser.

Use **`--output <path>`** to write the report to a file; if omitted, output is written to stdout.

```bash
# Audit report (JSON) to file
aimo validate <path-to-bundle> --format audit-json --output aimo_validation_report.json

# Audit report (HTML) to file
aimo validate <path-to-bundle> --format audit-html --output aimo_validation_report.html
```

If you run the validator as a script:

```bash
python validator/src/validate.py examples/evidence_bundle_v01_minimal --format audit-json --output aimo_validation_report.json
python validator/src/validate.py examples/evidence_bundle_v01_minimal --format audit-html --output aimo_validation_report.html
```

HTML reports can be converted to PDF using the browser’s print function (e.g. “Save as PDF”). This feature is for evidence readiness and integrity reporting only; it does not provide assurance or legal advice.

**How it appears on GitHub**: The Quality Gate workflow runs the validator with `--format sarif` and uploads the result via `upload-sarif`. When validation fails on a PR, the Security tab (Code Scanning) shows results for `aimo-standard/validation` so you can see which path and which error failed.

---

## What it checks

- **Schema validation**: root object, dictionary, and evidence conform to JSON Schema
- **Dictionary consistency**: all codes exist in taxonomy dictionary
- **Code status**: warns for deprecated codes, errors for removed codes

## What it does NOT check

- **Content accuracy**: validator checks structure, not meaning
- **Compliance guarantee**: passing validation does not guarantee regulatory compliance
- **Human judgment**: context-dependent decisions require human review (see [Human Oversight Protocol](../governance/human-oversight-protocol/))
- **Automatic log collection**: validator validates submitted evidence; it does not collect logs

---

## Resources

- **Specification**: [Standard > Current > Validator](../standard/current/07-validator/) — rules, reference checks, and how validation relates to evidence.
- **Rules and implementation**: repository `validator/rules/` (checks), `validator/src/` (reference implementation). Run and CI usage are described in the spec.
- **Interpretation**: what a validation "fail" means for auditors (explained in the spec).

For conformance and artifact usage, see [Conformance](../conformance/) and [Artifacts](../artifacts/).


---
<!-- page: https://standard.aimoaas.com/latest/examples/ -->

# Examples

This section points to end-to-end and minimal examples that show how artifacts are assembled.

- **Minimal bundle**: `examples/minimal/` in the repository (e.g., `sample_ev.json`, `sample_dictionary.json`).
- **Evidence Bundle (minimal)**: `examples/evidence_bundle_v01_minimal/` — normative minimal Bundle (manifest, object_index, payload_index, hash_chain, signing); see [Evidence Bundle](../artifacts/evidence-bundle/) and [Minimum Evidence](../artifacts/minimum-evidence/).
- **Evidence Bundle (EU AI Act Annex IV sample)**: `examples/evidence_bundle_v01_annex_iv_sample/` — official sample aligned with EU AI Act Annex IV technical documentation for high-risk AI; same structure as minimal, with root payload and an Annex IV technical documentation payload (`payloads/ANNEXIV_technical_documentation.md`). The bundle includes `signatures/` and `hashes/` and satisfies normative Evidence Bundle v0.1 path and coverage requirements. See [EU AI Act mapping](../coverage-map/eu-ai-act/) and profile `coverage_map/profiles/eu_ai_act_annex_iv.json`.
- **Schema alignment**: validate against `schemas/jsonschema/` and [Standard](../standard/current/).
- **Audit-ready packaging**: see the [Trust Package](../governance/trust-package/).

### GPAI CoP evidence bundle outline

For **EU GPAI Code of Practice** alignment, attach the **Model Documentation Form** (or equivalent) as an external form:

1. Add the form file (e.g. PDF or DOC) under `payloads/` and assign a stable `logical_id` (e.g. `GPAI_MODEL_DOC_FORM`) in the bundle `manifest.json` `payload_index`.
2. Record the file path, `sha256`, `mime`, and `size` in the payload_index so the bundle remains integrity-verifiable.
3. Reference the form in your coverage map or handoff index so auditors can trace between the GPAI form and AIMO taxonomy/bundle objects.

Profile: `coverage_map/profiles/eu_gp_ai_cop.json`. See [EV Template — External Forms](../standard/current/06-ev-template/#external-forms-official-templateschecklists-attached-as-is) and [Procurement & Disclosure Overlays](../coverage-map/procurement-and-disclosure/) for UK/Japan overlays.

Detailed scenario coverage is added in later change units.

# Human Oversight Protocol

This page defines the boundary between what automated validation (Validator) can check and what requires human review (Human-in-the-Loop). It clarifies the responsibilities for machine vs. human judgment in AI governance evidence processes.

## Purpose

Automated validation tools can efficiently check structural and syntactic correctness, but cannot replace human judgment for context-dependent decisions. This protocol:

- Clarifies what the Validator can and cannot verify
- Defines the scope of human review required for effective governance
- Supports audit explanations by documenting the human oversight process
- Provides a framework for organizations implementing AI governance workflows

## What automated validation can do (Validator scope)

The AIMO Validator and similar automated tools can check:

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Completeness of required fields/documents** | Verify that all mandatory fields are present in manifests, EV records, and other artifacts |
| **Structural consistency** | Validate references, IDs, and cross-links between artifacts (e.g., request_id → review_id) |
| **Schema validation** | Check that JSON/YAML artifacts conform to defined schemas |
| **Code format validation** | Verify that taxonomy codes match expected patterns (e.g., `UC-001`) |
| **Integrity checks** | Validate hash format and presence (not recomputation against content) |
| **Dictionary validation** | Confirm that codes exist in the taxonomy dictionary |

See [Validator](../../standard/current/07-validator/) for detailed validation rules and reference implementation.

## What requires human review (Human-in-the-Loop scope)

The following areas require human judgment and cannot be automated:

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Context-dependent risk judgment** | Assessing business, ethical, and operational risks based on organizational context |
| **Exception approval rationale** | Evaluating whether an exception is justified and compensating controls are adequate |
| **Remediation decision-making** | Prioritizing fixes, allocating resources, and determining timelines |
| **Policy trade-offs** | Balancing competing requirements (e.g., speed vs. thoroughness, cost vs. risk) |
| **Residual risk acceptance** | Deciding whether remaining risks are acceptable after controls |
| **Cross-domain impact assessment** | Evaluating implications for legal, HR, operations, and other functions |
| **Content accuracy verification** | Confirming that evidence content is factually correct and complete |
| **Stakeholder communication** | Explaining decisions to auditors, regulators, and leadership |

## Responsibility boundary

| Aspect | Validator (Machine) | Human Reviewer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Structure** | ✓ Can verify | Review if flagged |
| **Completeness** | ✓ Can verify fields | Verify content adequacy |
| **Format** | ✓ Can verify | — |
| **Risk judgment** | ✗ Cannot assess | ✓ Must assess |
| **Exception approval** | ✗ Cannot decide | ✓ Must decide |
| **Remediation priority** | ✗ Cannot prioritize | ✓ Must prioritize |
| **Legal interpretation** | ✗ Cannot interpret | ✓ Must verify with counsel |
| **Audit conclusion** | ✗ Cannot conclude | ✓ Auditor responsibility |

!!! note "Complementary roles"
    Validator and human review are **complementary**, not alternatives. Validator ensures structural consistency before human review; human review ensures contextual appropriateness.

## Evidence expectations

Organizations implementing human oversight should document:

| Evidence Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Review record** | Who reviewed, when, and what decision was made |
| **Approval rationale** | Why the decision was made (especially for exceptions) |
| **Escalation record** | When and why issues were escalated to higher authority |
| **Remediation plan** | Planned actions, owners, and timelines for addressing issues |
| **Sign-off** | Formal attestation that review was completed |

These records should be included in the Evidence Bundle per [Minimum Evidence Requirements](../../artifacts/minimum-evidence/).

## Non-overclaim

!!! warning "Important"
    This protocol defines a **framework for documenting human oversight**. It does **not**:

    - Provide legal advice or regulatory interpretation
    - Guarantee compliance with any regulation or standard
    - Replace qualified human judgment with automated decisions
    - Prescribe specific organizational processes

    Organizations must adapt this framework to their specific context, risk profile, and regulatory requirements.

# Responsibility Boundary

This page defines what the AIMO Standard provides and does not provide, the assumptions it makes, and the responsibilities of adopters.

## Proof vs assurance boundary

| Boundary | What AIMO provides | Who decides |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Proof (evidence)** | Evidence Bundle structure, validators, schemas, templates, coverage mappings (informative). AIMO produces **evidence packs** and **validators** that check structural conformance. | Adopter produces evidence; AIMO defines format and rules. |
| **Assurance / compliance / certification** | AIMO does **not** issue certifications, assurance opinions, or compliance decisions. | **External:** customer, auditor, or **accredited certification body** decides compliance and certification. |

Conformance and claim language are unified in [Conformance](../../conformance/) and the [ISO 42001 Certification Readiness Toolkit](../../artifacts/iso-42001-certification-readiness-toolkit/). AIMO supports **evidence readiness** and **audit handoff**; it does not certify or guarantee compliance.

## What AIMO Standard provides

- **A structured evidence format**: schemas, templates, and taxonomy for AI governance evidence.
- **Traceability framework**: lifecycle-based evidence linking (request → review → exception → renewal).
- **Explainability support**: coverage mapping to external frameworks for audit discussions.
- **Validation tooling**: reference validator and rules for structural consistency checks.
- **Documentation**: normative specification, examples, and guidance.

## What AIMO Standard does NOT provide

| Out-of-scope | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| **Legal advice** | AIMO does not interpret laws or regulations. Consult qualified legal counsel for regulatory compliance. |
| **Compliance certification** | Using AIMO does not certify compliance with any regulation or framework (ISO 42001, EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, etc.). |
| **"ISO certified by AIMO"** | AIMO does not issue certifications. Certification is performed by accredited certification bodies. |
| **"EU AI Act compliant because of AIMO"** | AIMO structures evidence; it does not guarantee or certify regulatory compliance. |
| **Risk assessment** | AIMO structures evidence but does not perform or validate AI risk assessments. |
| **Technical controls** | AIMO does not implement access control, encryption, or other security controls; it documents expectations. |
| **Audit execution** | AIMO provides materials for auditors but does not conduct audits. |
| **AI model evaluation** | AIMO does not assess model performance, bias, or safety. |

## Assumptions

The AIMO Standard assumes:

1. **Adopters have governance processes**: request, review, approval, and exception workflows exist.
2. **Adopters maintain evidence**: evidence is created, stored, and retained by the adopter's systems.
3. **Adopters verify against authoritative texts**: when using Coverage Map, adopters check the original framework or regulation.
4. **Tooling is optional**: the reference validator is a convenience; adopters may use their own validation.

## Adopter responsibilities

| Responsibility | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Evidence creation** | Generate accurate, timely evidence records aligned with EV schema. |
| **Evidence storage & retention** | Store evidence securely with appropriate access controls and retention periods. |
| **Integrity & access control** | Implement controls (hashing, WORM, audit logs) to preserve evidence integrity. |
| **Legal verification** | Verify compliance claims against authoritative legal texts and obtain legal advice as needed. |
| **Continuous alignment** | Update evidence and mappings as AIMO Standard versions and external frameworks evolve. |
| **Audit preparation** | Package evidence bundles and run validation before submission to auditors. |

## RACI Matrix

The following RACI matrix clarifies responsibilities across AIMO Standard, Adopter, and Auditor roles.

| Activity | AIMO Standard | Adopter | Auditor |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Define evidence schema & templates** | R/A | I | I |
| **Create evidence records** | — | R/A | I |
| **Store & retain evidence** | — | R/A | I |
| **Implement access controls** | — | R/A | I |
| **Implement integrity controls (hash, WORM)** | — | R/A | I |
| **Run validator on bundle** | C | R/A | C |
| **Package submission (zip, checksums)** | C | R/A | I |
| **Verify checksums (sha256)** | — | C | R/A |
| **Verify bundle structure (validator)** | — | C | R/A |
| **Interpret regulatory requirements** | — | R/A | C |
| **Issue audit conclusion** | — | — | R/A |
| **Provide legal advice** | — | — | — |

**Legend**: R = Responsible, A = Accountable, C = Consulted, I = Informed, — = Not applicable

!!! note "Key takeaway"
    AIMO Standard is responsible for **defining the format**. Adopters are responsible for **creating, storing, and validating evidence**. Auditors are responsible for **verifying submissions and issuing audit conclusions**.

!!! warning "Non-certification notice"
    AIMO Standard is informative; it does not certify compliance or provide legal advice. Audit conclusions and conformity assessments are the sole responsibility of qualified auditors and legal professionals.

## Claims policy

| Acceptable | Unacceptable |
| --- | --- |
| "An Evidence Bundle was produced according to AIMO Standard v0.1.2 and structurally validated by the AIMO Validator." |  "EU AI Act compliant", "ISO 42001 certified", "government approved"  |
| "We use AIMO artifacts to support ISO/IEC 42001 readiness; certification decisions remain with accredited certification bodies." | Claiming that AIMO certifies compliance or provides legal advice. |

## Non-overclaim statement

!!! warning "Important"
    The AIMO Standard supports **explainability and evidence readiness**. It does **not** provide legal advice, guarantee compliance, or certify conformity to any regulation or framework. Adopters must verify claims against authoritative texts and obtain professional advice as appropriate.

This statement applies to all AIMO Standard documentation, including Trust Package, Evidence Bundle, Minimum Evidence Requirements, Coverage Map, and Releases.

# SEO & Canonical Policy

This page documents how AIMO Standard manages URL canonicalization for search engines, auditors, and external references.

## Production vs Mirror Sites

| Environment | URL | Role | Indexable |
|-------------|-----|------|-----------|
| **Production** | `https://standard.aimoaas.com/` | Canonical site for all purposes | Yes |
| GitHub Pages | `https://billyrise.github.io/aimo-standard/` | Temporary mirror / CI preview | No (noindex) |

**Key principle**: Production (`standard.aimoaas.com`) is the authoritative URL. GitHub Pages serves as a temporary backup/mirror and should not be cited in audit reports or external references.

## Canonical URL Strategy

### How Canonical URLs Are Generated

AIMO Standard uses [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) with the following configuration:

```yaml
# mkdocs.yml
site_url: https://standard.aimoaas.com/
```

This `site_url` setting ensures:

1. **`<link rel="canonical">`** — Each generated HTML page includes a canonical link pointing to the Production URL.
2. **`sitemap.xml`** — All URLs in the sitemap reference Production.
3. **`robots.txt`** — Sitemap reference points to Production.
4. **`hreflang` alternates** — Language alternates use Production URLs.

### Language-Specific Canonicals

| Language | URL Pattern | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| English (default) | `https://standard.aimoaas.com/{X.Y.Z}/{path}` | `https://standard.aimoaas.com/{X.Y.Z}/governance/` |
| Japanese | `https://standard.aimoaas.com/{X.Y.Z}/ja/{path}` | `https://standard.aimoaas.com/{X.Y.Z}/ja/governance/` |

Each language version is self-canonical and includes `hreflang` alternates to the other language(s) plus `x-default` pointing to the English version.

### Versioned Documentation and Canonicals

AIMO Standard uses [mike](https://github.com/jimporter/mike) for documentation versioning with `alias_type: redirect`:

| Version | URL Pattern | Canonical Status | Indexable |
|---------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| Versioned (e.g., `0.0.1`) | `https://standard.aimoaas.com/0.0.1/` | Canonical for that specific version | Yes |
| `latest` (alias) | `https://standard.aimoaas.com/latest/` | **Redirects** to current release | Yes (via target) |
| `dev` | `https://standard.aimoaas.com/dev/` | Preview only | **No** (noindex enforced) |

**Critical distinctions:**

| Aspect | `/X.Y.Z/` | `/latest/` | `/dev/` |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Content | Frozen snapshot | Redirect to `/X.Y.Z/` | Main branch preview |
| Mutable | Never | Pointer updates on release | Continuous |
| For audits | **Yes (preferred)** | Yes (resolves to frozen) | **Never** |
| SEO | Indexed | Indexed via target | noindex |

**How alias_type: redirect works:**

Instead of copying files, `/latest/` contains redirect pages pointing to the current release:

```html

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=../{X.Y.Z}/">
<link rel="canonical" href="https://standard.aimoaas.com/{X.Y.Z}/">
```

This ensures:

1. **No content drift** — `/latest/` cannot diverge from the release it points to.
2. **No duplicate content** — Search engines see one canonical source.
3. **Atomic updates** — Changing the alias updates all pages at once.

!!! info "Git Tag vs. Site Path"
    Git release tags use `v` prefix (e.g., `v0.0.1`), but site paths omit the `v` (e.g., `/0.0.1/`). This is standard practice for documentation versioning tools like mike.

## Auditor Guidance: Which URL to Cite

When citing AIMO Standard in audit reports, compliance documentation, or external references:

### Recommended Citation URLs

| Use Case | Recommended URL |
|----------|-----------------|
| Current stable specification | `https://standard.aimoaas.com/{X.Y.Z}/standard/current/` |
| Specific version (for audit) | `https://standard.aimoaas.com/{X.Y.Z}/standard/current/` |
| Governance & policies | `https://standard.aimoaas.com/{X.Y.Z}/governance/` |
| Trust Package | `https://standard.aimoaas.com/{X.Y.Z}/governance/trust-package/` |

### Do NOT Cite

- ~~`https://billyrise.github.io/aimo-standard/`~~ — Temporary mirror, not canonical
- ~~`https://standard.aimoaas.com/dev/`~~ — Development version, subject to change

### Versioned Citation for Immutability

For formal audits requiring immutable references, use versioned snapshot URLs:

```
https://standard.aimoaas.com/1.0.0/standard/current/01-overview/
```

Versioned snapshots are frozen at release time and will not change.

!!! note "URL Format"
    Site paths use version numbers without the `v` prefix. For version `v1.0.0`, use `/1.0.0/` in URLs.

## Technical Implementation

### Generated HTML Example

Every generated HTML page includes canonical and hreflang tags in the `<head>`. Two patterns apply:

**1. Latest alias (redirect stub)** — Pages under `/latest/` redirect to the current release; the canonical and hreflang in the stub point at the versioned snapshot (see snippet above in "How alias_type: redirect works").

**2. Versioned snapshot canonical** — When the page is served under `/{X.Y.Z}/`, the canonical MUST point at the versioned URL so that audit citations use a frozen snapshot:

```html

<link rel="canonical" href="https://standard.aimoaas.com/{X.Y.Z}/governance/">
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="https://standard.aimoaas.com/{X.Y.Z}/governance/">
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="ja" href="https://standard.aimoaas.com/{X.Y.Z}/ja/governance/">
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="x-default" href="https://standard.aimoaas.com/{X.Y.Z}/governance/">
```

### robots.txt

Production is **fully crawlable**. There is no global crawler block. Only the `/dev/` preview path is disallowed.

```
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Allow: /latest/

# Disallow dev preview only (unreleased content — not for audit citation)
Disallow: /dev/

Sitemap: https://standard.aimoaas.com/sitemap.xml
```

From v0.1.1 onward, SEO must be world-class: the canonical site must be indexable by all major search engines; `noindex` and `robots.txt` Disallow apply only to `/dev/` and mirror sites, never to production `/` or `/latest/`.

### Sitemap

The sitemap is generated by `mkdocs-static-i18n` plugin and includes:

- All Production URLs
- `hreflang` alternates for each language

## Noindex Configuration

### `/dev/` (Preview) — Mandatory Noindex

The `/dev/` version contains unreleased content and MUST have noindex to prevent:

- Search engines indexing unstable content
- Users finding `/dev/` via search and citing it in audits
- Confusion between released and unreleased content

**Implementation:**

The `deploy-dev.yml` workflow injects a noindex meta tag into all `/dev/` pages via theme override:

```html

<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
```

### GitHub Pages Mirror — Noindex

When deploying to GitHub Pages (the mirror site at `billyrise.github.io`), all pages should have noindex to prevent duplicate indexing:

```html
<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
```

This ensures search engines always prioritize the Production canonical URLs at `standard.aimoaas.com`.

## Verification

After each build, you can verify canonical URLs and crawler access by:

1. **Inspecting generated HTML** — Check `site/` directory after `mkdocs build`
2. **Using browser DevTools** — Inspect `<head>` section on deployed pages
3. **Checking robots.txt** — Ensure `https://standard.aimoaas.com/robots.txt` contains `Allow: /` and `Allow: /latest/`, and only `Disallow: /dev/`. No global Disallow.
4. **Google Search Console** — Monitor which URLs are indexed and any crawl errors

Example verification command:

```bash
mkdocs build
grep -r 'rel="canonical"' site/ | head -5
```

Expected output should show Production URLs, e.g.:

```
site/index.html:<link rel="canonical" href="https://standard.aimoaas.com/">
site/governance/index.html:<link rel="canonical" href="https://standard.aimoaas.com/governance/">
```

## Responsibility boundary

The Trust Package is an **assurance and audit handoff** entry point: it consolidates materials for auditors and adopters. The AIMO Standard provides a structured evidence format and explainability framework; it does **not** certify, guarantee compliance, provide legal advice, or conduct audits. Certification and compliance decisions remain with accredited certification bodies, auditors, and the adopting organization.

For the full scope definition, assumptions, and adopter responsibilities, see [Responsibility Boundary](../responsibility-boundary/) and [Conformance](../../conformance/).

## How to prepare a submission package

Follow these steps to prepare an audit-ready submission:

1. **Generate Evidence Bundle**: Create EV records, Dictionary, Summary, and Change Log per [Evidence Bundle](../../artifacts/evidence-bundle/) and [Minimum Evidence Requirements](../../artifacts/minimum-evidence/). For ISO 42001–oriented readiness, see the [ISO 42001 Certification Readiness Toolkit](../../artifacts/iso-42001-certification-readiness-toolkit/).
2. **Run Validator**: Execute `python validator/src/validate.py bundle/root.json` to check structural consistency. Fix any errors before proceeding.
3. **Create Checksums**: Generate SHA-256 checksums for all submission files:

    === "Linux"

        ```bash
        sha256sum *.json *.pdf > SHA256SUMS.txt
        ```

    === "macOS"

        ```bash
        shasum -a 256 *.json *.pdf > SHA256SUMS.txt
        ```

    === "Windows (PowerShell)"

        ```powershell
        Get-ChildItem *.json, *.pdf | ForEach-Object {
            $hash = (Get-FileHash $_.FullName -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()
            "$hash  $($_.Name)"
        } | Out-File SHA256SUMS.txt -Encoding UTF8
        ```
4. **Package Artifacts**: Create a zip archive of your evidence bundle:
   ```bash
   zip -r evidence_bundle.zip bundle_directory/
   ```
5. **Reference Release Version**: Note which AIMO Standard version (e.g., `v1.0.0`) your bundle aligns with.
6. **Deliver**: Provide the zip, checksums, and version reference to your auditor or compliance function.

For release assets and verification, see [Releases](../../releases/).

## Non-overclaim statement

!!! warning "Important: No certification, no assurance, no legal compliance claim"
    - AIMO Standard defines an **evidence packaging and validation format**. It does not certify compliance with laws or standards.
    - Audit/assurance opinions remain the responsibility of independent auditors and the adopting organization.
    - **Appropriate claim:** "An Evidence Bundle was produced according to AIMO Standard v0.1.2 and structurally validated by the AIMO Validator."
    - **Inappropriate claim:**  "EU AI Act compliant", "ISO 42001 certified", "government approved". 

See [Responsibility Boundary](../responsibility-boundary/) for details on scope, assumptions, and adopter responsibilities.

## For auditors: Verification procedure

When receiving an evidence submission, auditors should verify integrity and structure using the following steps:

!!! success "Build Provenance Available"
    All release assets include cryptographically signed build attestations. See [Verification Procedure](../../standard/versions/#4-verify-build-provenance-attestation) for attestation verification steps.

### Step 1: Verify checksums (SHA-256)

=== "Linux"

    ```bash
    # Download or receive SHA256SUMS.txt with the submission
    # Verify all files match their recorded checksums
    sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt

    # Or verify individual files manually:
    sha256sum evidence_bundle.zip
    # Compare output against the value in SHA256SUMS.txt
    ```

=== "macOS"

    ```bash
    # Verify all files match their recorded checksums
    shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS.txt

    # Or verify individual files manually:
    shasum -a 256 evidence_bundle.zip
    # Compare output against the value in SHA256SUMS.txt
    ```

=== "Windows (PowerShell)"

    ```powershell
    # Verify individual files
    Get-FileHash .\evidence_bundle.zip -Algorithm SHA256

    # Compare the Hash output with SHA256SUMS.txt
    Get-Content .\SHA256SUMS.txt
    ```

If any checksum fails, the submission should be rejected or re-requested.

### Step 2: Verify bundle structure (Validator)

**Prerequisites** (one-time setup):

```bash
# Clone the official AIMO Standard release
git clone https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard.git
cd aimo-standard

# IMPORTANT: Use the exact version stated in the submission
# Replace VERSION with the submitter's declared version (e.g., v0.0.1)
VERSION=v0.0.1  # ← Match the version in the submission
git checkout "$VERSION"

# Set up Python environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

!!! warning "Version Matching"
    Always use the exact AIMO Standard version stated in the submission. Using a different version may cause validation mismatches due to schema or rule changes between versions.

**Run validation**:

```bash
# Extract the submitted bundle
unzip evidence_bundle.zip -d bundle/

# Run validator against the bundle's root.json
python validator/src/validate.py bundle/root.json

# Expected output: "validation OK" or list of errors
```

**Example** (using built-in sample):

```bash
python validator/src/validate.py examples/evidence_bundle_minimal/root.json
```

The validator checks:

- Required files exist (EV records, Dictionary)
- JSON files conform to schema
- Cross-references (request_id, review_id, etc.) are valid
- Timestamps are present and properly formatted

### Step 3: Verify version alignment

Check that the submission references an official AIMO Standard release:

1. Confirm the stated version (e.g., `v0.0.1`) exists at [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/releases)
2. Compare submitted schemas against the release artifacts
3. Note any deviations from the official release

### What to look for

| Check | Pass Criteria | Fail Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Checksums match | All `sha256sum -c` checks pass | Reject or re-request |
| Validator passes | No errors from `validate.py` | Request fixes before acceptance |
| Version exists | Release tag exists on GitHub | Clarify version alignment |
| Required fields present | EV records have id, timestamp, source, summary | Request completion |
| Traceability intact | Cross-references resolve correctly | Request linkage fixes |

!!! info "Auditor independence"
    Auditors should obtain the validator and schemas directly from the official AIMO Standard release, not from the submitting party, to ensure verification independence.

## Audit journey

From this page, the recommended audit journey is:

1. **Classification system**: [Taxonomy](../../standard/current/03-taxonomy/) + [Dictionary](../../standard/current/05-dictionary/) — understand the 8-dimension code system
2. **Evidence structure**: [Evidence Bundle](../../artifacts/evidence-bundle/) — understand bundle TOC and traceability
3. **Required evidence**: [Minimum Evidence Requirements](../../artifacts/minimum-evidence/) — MUST-level checklist by lifecycle
4. **Framework alignment**: [Coverage Map](../../coverage-map/) + [Methodology](../../coverage-map/methodology/) — see how AIMO maps to external frameworks
5. **Validation**: [Validator](../../validator/) — run structural consistency checks
6. **Download**: [Releases](../../releases/) — get release assets and verify checksums

## Preparing your submission package

When preparing evidence for audit submission:

1. **Create your Evidence Bundle**: Follow [Evidence Bundle](../artifacts/evidence-bundle/) and [Minimum Evidence Requirements](../artifacts/minimum-evidence/) to create EV records, Dictionary, Summary, and Change Log.
2. **Run the Validator**: Execute `python validator/src/validate.py bundle/root.json` to check structural consistency. Fix all errors before proceeding.
3. **Generate Checksums**: Create SHA-256 checksums for verification:

    === "Linux"

        ```bash
        sha256sum *.json *.pdf > SHA256SUMS.txt
        ```

    === "macOS"

        ```bash
        shasum -a 256 *.json *.pdf > SHA256SUMS.txt
        ```

    === "Windows (PowerShell)"

        ```powershell
        Get-ChildItem *.json, *.pdf | ForEach-Object {
            $hash = (Get-FileHash $_.FullName -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()
            "$hash  $($_.Name)"
        } | Out-File SHA256SUMS.txt -Encoding UTF8
        ```
4. **Package**: Create a zip archive of your bundle directory.
5. **Document version alignment**: Note which AIMO Standard release (e.g., `v1.0.0`) your evidence aligns with.
6. **Deliver**: Provide the package, checksums, and version reference to your auditor.

For the complete preparation guide, see [Trust Package](../governance/trust-package/).

## For auditors: Verification procedure

Auditors receiving evidence submissions should verify integrity and structure:

1. **Verify checksums**: Run checksum verification (Linux: `sha256sum -c`, macOS: `shasum -a 256 -c`, Windows: `Get-FileHash`) to confirm file integrity
2. **Run validator**: Execute `python validator/src/validate.py bundle/root.json` to check structure
3. **Confirm version**: Verify the stated AIMO Standard version exists at [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/releases)

!!! tip "Obtain tools independently"
    Auditors should download the validator and schemas directly from the official AIMO Standard release, not from the submitting party.

For the full verification procedure (checksums, attestation, step-by-step), see **[Standard → Versions → Verification Procedure](../standard/versions/#verification-procedure)**. See also [Trust Package](../governance/trust-package/) for auditor-ready materials.

## Non-overclaim statement

!!! warning "Important"
    The AIMO Standard supports **explainability and evidence readiness**. It does **not** provide legal advice, guarantee compliance, or certify conformity to any regulation or framework. Adopters must verify claims against authoritative texts and obtain professional advice as appropriate.

See [Responsibility Boundary](../governance/responsibility-boundary/) for scope, assumptions, and adopter responsibilities.

# Localization Guide

This page documents the localization (i18n) structure, maintenance workflow, and SSOT (Single Source of Truth) principles for the AIMO Standard documentation.

## Language Purity Policy

**Each language page should contain only that language's content.**

| Rule | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **EN pages** | Must not contain CJK characters or references to language-specific columns (e.g., `_ja` suffixes) |
| **JA pages** | Must not explain EN-specific terminology as if it were the canonical structure |
| **Exceptions** | Listed in `MIXED_LANGUAGE_ALLOWLIST` in `tooling/checks/lint_i18n.py` |

This policy ensures:
1. Readers see only their selected language
2. Adding new languages doesn't require updating existing pages
3. CI can automatically detect violations

## Language Structure

The AIMO Standard documentation uses a **folder-based i18n structure**:

```
docs/
├── en/           # English (canonical)
├── ja/           # Japanese
├── es/           # Spanish (Español)
├── fr/           # French (Français)
├── de/           # German (Deutsch)
├── pt/           # Portuguese (Português)
├── it/           # Italian (Italiano)
├── zh/           # Simplified Chinese
├── zh-TW/        # Traditional Chinese
└── ko/           # Korean
```

- **English is canonical**: The `docs/en/` folder is the authoritative source for documentation content.
- **Other languages mirror the structure**: Each language folder (`ja/`, etc.) maintains the same file structure as `en/`.
- **Same file names**: All languages use `.md` extension (no language suffix in filenames).
- **Fallback to English**: Missing translations automatically fall back to English content.

## Taxonomy Data Model

The taxonomy uses a **language-neutral canonical structure** with separate translation packs:

```
data/
└── taxonomy/
    ├── canonical.yaml           # Language-neutral (codes, status, lifecycle)
    └── i18n/
        ├── en.yaml              # English labels and definitions
        ├── ja.yaml              # Japanese labels and definitions
        └── {lang}.yaml          # Additional languages (empty template)
```

### Canonical Structure (`canonical.yaml`)

Contains language-neutral data:

- Code identifiers (e.g., `FS-001`, `UC-001`)
- Status (`active`, `deprecated`, `removed`)
- Lifecycle metadata (`introduced_in`, `deprecated_in`, `removed_in`, `replaced_by`)
- Scope notes and examples (in English, as technical references)

### Translation Packs (`i18n/*.yaml`)

Each language pack contains:

- Dimension names (e.g., "Functional Scope")
- Code labels (e.g., "End-user Productivity")
- Code definitions

**Fallback**: If a translation is missing, the system uses English.

## SSOT Principle

AIMO uses a **SSOT-first architecture** for taxonomy data:

| Asset Type | SSOT Location | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Taxonomy (structure)** | `data/taxonomy/canonical.yaml` | Language-neutral structure (SSOT) |
| **Taxonomy (i18n)** | `data/taxonomy/i18n/*.yaml` | Per-language translations (SSOT) |
| **Coverage Map** | `coverage_map/coverage_map.yaml` | Framework-to-evidence mapping |
| **Schemas** | `schemas/jsonschema/` | JSON validation schemas |

### Derived Files

The following files are **generated** from the SSOT and should NOT be edited manually:

| File | Generated From | Generator |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `artifacts/taxonomy/{version}/{lang}/taxonomy_dictionary.csv` | canonical + i18n | `build_artifacts.py` |
| `source_pack/03_taxonomy/legacy/taxonomy_dictionary_v0.1.csv` | canonical + i18n | `build_artifacts.py` |
| `source_pack/03_taxonomy/taxonomy_en.yaml` | canonical + i18n | `build_artifacts.py` |
| `source_pack/03_taxonomy/taxonomy_ja.yaml` | canonical + i18n | `build_artifacts.py` |
| `source_pack/03_taxonomy/code_system.csv` | canonical + i18n | `build_artifacts.py` |
| `source_pack/03_taxonomy/dimensions_en_ja.md` | canonical + i18n | `build_artifacts.py` |
| `source_pack/03_taxonomy/taxonomy_dictionary.json` | canonical + i18n | `build_artifacts.py` |

### Language Codes (BCP47)

AIMO uses BCP47 language codes:

| Code | Language | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `en` | English | Canonical (source) |
| `ja` | Japanese | Active |
| `es` | Spanish (Español) | Active |
| `fr` | French (Français) | Active |
| `de` | German (Deutsch) | Active |
| `pt` | Portuguese (Português) | Active |
| `it` | Italian (Italiano) | Active |
| `zh` | Simplified Chinese | Active |
| `zh-TW` | Traditional Chinese | Active |
| `ko` | Korean | Active |

### Legacy CSV Files (Frozen)

The legacy EN/JA mixed CSV files in `source_pack/03_taxonomy/legacy/` are:

- **Frozen at 21 columns** — no new language columns will be added
- **Maintained for backward compatibility** — existing integrations can continue to use them
- **CI-enforced** — adding `label_es`, `definition_de`, etc. will fail the build

For new languages, use the per-language artifacts in `artifacts/taxonomy/{version}/{lang}/`.

## Translation Freshness Tracking

AIMO uses a **Translation Freshness Tracking** system to maintain consistency between English (source) and translated content.

### How It Works

1. Each translated file contains metadata tracking which version of the English source it was translated from
2. When English content is updated, the system detects outdated translations
3. CI warns about outdated translations but does not block (translations can lag behind)

### Translation Metadata

Translated files include frontmatter metadata:

```yaml
---
# TRANSLATION METADATA - DO NOT REMOVE
source_file: en/standard/current/01-overview.md
source_hash: abc123def456
translation_date: 2026-02-02
translator: human|machine|hybrid
translation_status: current|outdated|needs_review
---
```

### Translation status marker (hidden)

Every doc page includes a **hidden HTML comment** in the source (immediately after the frontmatter) so that scripts and tools can detect whether the page is the English source or a translated/untranslated variant. It is not visible on the rendered site.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `` | English canonical page (`docs/en/`). |
| `` | This locale’s content is a translation of the English source. |
| `` | This locale’s file exists but content is still the English copy; translation pending. |

**How to use**

- To list untranslated pages: `grep -r "aimo:translation_status=untranslated" docs/`
- When adding a new language or page, run `python tooling/i18n/add_translation_markers.py` to insert or fix markers. Use `--strict` to detect untranslated by comparing the first 400 characters of the body with the English file.
- After translating a page, set the marker to `translated` (or re-run the script so it can update the marker).

### Using the Sync Tool

```bash
# Check all translations for freshness
python tooling/i18n/sync_translations.py --check

# Check specific language
python tooling/i18n/sync_translations.py --check --lang ja

# Generate translation report
python tooling/i18n/sync_translations.py --report

# Initialize new language (copy EN as base)
python tooling/i18n/sync_translations.py --init-lang es

# Update metadata after completing translation
python tooling/i18n/sync_translations.py --update-meta docs/ja/index.md
```

For detailed technical specification, see `tooling/i18n/TRANSLATION_SYNC_SPEC.md`.

## Update Workflows

### Taxonomy Updates (New SSOT-First Workflow)

1. Edit the SSOT in `data/taxonomy/`:
   - Structure changes → `canonical.yaml`
   - English translations → `i18n/en.yaml`
   - Japanese translations → `i18n/ja.yaml`
2. Run validation: `python tooling/checks/lint_taxonomy_ssot.py`
3. Regenerate all derived files: `python tooling/taxonomy/build_artifacts.py --version current --langs en ja`
4. Update documentation pages as needed
5. Commit all changes together

### Coverage Map Updates

1. Edit `coverage_map/coverage_map.yaml` (the SSOT)
2. Update the corresponding framework page tables (`docs/en/coverage-map/*.md`)
3. Update Japanese translations (`docs/ja/coverage-map/*.md`)
4. Commit all changes together

### Documentation Updates

1. Edit the English source (`docs/en/...`)
2. Update translations as needed (or mark them for later update)
3. Run `python tooling/i18n/sync_translations.py --check` to see outdated translations
4. Run `python tooling/checks/lint_i18n.py` to verify heading consistency
5. Run `mkdocs build --strict` to verify build
6. Commit all changes together

!!! tip "Reuse previous release translations to minimize work"
    When fixing **translation gaps** for a new release (e.g. v0.1.2), always **check the previous release** (e.g. v0.1.1) first:
    1. Get the translated file from the previous tag: `git show v0.1.1:docs/ja/governance/trust-package.md`
    2. If the English source is **unchanged or only minor** (e.g. link path or one new section), **copy the previous translation** and apply only the **delta** (link path updates, new paragraphs, frontmatter).
    3. Re-translate from scratch only when the English content has changed substantially.
    This keeps translation effort minimal and preserves existing wording where it still matches.

!!! note "Translation Priority"
    Not all translations need to be updated immediately. Tier 1 (critical) pages should be prioritized:
    
    - `index.md`
    - `standard/current/*.md`
    - `governance/index.md`
    - `releases/`

## Adding a New Language (5 Steps)

To add a new language (e.g., Spanish):

### Step 1: Generate Taxonomy Pack

```bash
python tooling/taxonomy/build_i18n_taxonomy.py --add-lang es --lang-name "Español"
```

Creates `data/taxonomy/i18n/es.yaml` with English references as comments.

### Step 2: Create Docs Folder

```bash
mkdir -p docs/es && cp -r docs/en/* docs/es/
```

### Step 3: Update mkdocs.yml

```yaml
plugins:

# Versioning & Reference Policy

This page defines the **operational policy** for documentation URLs. Third parties (auditors, implementers, and tooling) MUST interpret URLs according to these rules.

## Normative URL semantics

| URL pattern | Meaning | MUST |
|-------------|---------|------|
| **`/X.Y.Z/`** (e.g. `/0.0.3/`) | **Immutable release** — frozen snapshot. Content MUST NOT change after release. | Use for audit citations and reproducible references. Once published, `/X.Y.Z/` is **never** rewritten. |
| **`/latest/`** | **Latest stable release only.** Alias (redirect) to the most recent **released** version. | MUST point only to a tagged release. MUST NOT point to development, PR previews, or `/dev/`. |
| **`/dev/`** | **Development (unstable).** Preview of the main branch; content may change at any time. | MUST NOT be used for audit submission or citation. For reference and reproducibility, use `/latest/` or `/X.Y.Z/` instead. |

## Rules (MUST)

1. **`/X.Y.Z/` is immutable.**  
   A released version directory is frozen at release time. No further edits, fixes, or replacements to that path are permitted. If a fix is required, release a new version (e.g. `X.Y.Z+1`).

2. **`/latest/` means “latest stable” only.**  
   `/latest/` MUST redirect to the current **tagged** release (e.g. the version indicated by the GitHub Releases “latest” tag). It MUST NOT serve development builds, pull-request previews, or unreleased content.

3. **`/dev/` is development (unstable).**  
   `/dev/` reflects the current main branch and is explicitly **unreleased**. It MUST NOT be cited or submitted as evidence in audits. The site MAY apply `noindex` and/or a visible “Development Preview” notice for `/dev/` to avoid misuse.

4. **Release process updates `/latest/`.**  
   The `/latest/` alias is updated **only** by the official release process. That process MUST:
   - Be triggered by a **version tag** (e.g. `vX.Y.Z`) pushed to the repository;
   - Run quality gates (tests, lints) before deploy;
   - Deploy the versioned documentation to `/X.Y.Z/`;
   - Set or update the `latest` alias to point to that `/X.Y.Z/` (e.g. via `mike set-default latest` or equivalent);
   - Create the corresponding GitHub Release with assets (e.g. PDFs, artifacts, checksums).

   Routine pushes to `main` (without a version tag) MUST NOT change `/latest/`; they may update `/dev/` only.

## Summary for auditors

- **Canonical, reproducible citation:** Use `https://standard.aimoaas.com/X.Y.Z/` (e.g. `0.0.3`) and record the version and, if needed, the release tag or commit from the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/releases) page.
- **General reference:** `/latest/` is acceptable as it redirects to the current stable release.
- **Do not cite:** `/dev/` — it is development-only and not for audit or submission.

!!! note "Data Source"
    This version table is synchronized with [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/releases). Each release tag (`vX.Y.Z`) corresponds to a frozen snapshot of the specification.

## /latest vs versioned URLs — avoid wrong citations

| URL | Use | Audit / evidence |
|-----|-----|------------------|
| **`/X.Y.Z/`** (e.g. `/0.1.1/`) | Frozen snapshot; never changes. | **MUST** use for audit citations and reproducible evidence. |
| **`/latest/`** | Redirect to the current release; updates when a new tag is released. | Reference only; **not recommended** for audit evidence (target can change). |

The **authoritative definition of "latest"** is the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/releases) **latest** tag. The site path `/latest/` is a redirect that points to that release. Only the **release workflow** (triggered by a tag push) updates `/latest/`; see [VERSIONING.md](https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/blob/main/VERSIONING.md).

| Source | Role |
|--------|------|
| **GitHub Release latest tag** | SSOT — the only definition of "current release" |
| **Versions table** (this page) | Synchronized with releases via release workflow; must match the tag before deploy |
| **Changelog** | Normative change history; release notes reference it |
| **Site `/latest/`** | Redirect to the same version as GitHub Release latest |

For release process details, see [VERSIONING.md](https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/blob/main/VERSIONING.md) and the [release workflow](https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml). The Versions table and Changelog are updated as part of release preparation so that they always match the deployed version.

## Legal and trademark notices

Trademark status and usage (including third-party ownership of "AIMO" and the fact that only AIMOaaS is filed by RISEby Inc.) are described in [Governance → Trademarks](../../governance/trademarks/) and in the repository [TRADEMARKS.md](https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/blob/main/TRADEMARKS.md). For the most current trademark and legal notices, use the documentation of the latest release or the linked TRADEMARKS.md.

## For auditors: Canonical URL and version pinning

To cite a specific version in audit reports and ensure reproducibility:

1. **Canonical URL**: Use the frozen documentation URL for that version, e.g.  
   `https://standard.aimoaas.com/0.1.1/` (replace `0.0.3` with the version you used).  
   **For v0.1.1 and later**: Prefer citing the versioned URL (e.g. `https://standard.aimoaas.com/0.1.1/`) rather than `/latest/` for audit evidence, so the snapshot is unambiguous.
2. **Version pinning**: Record the **release tag** (e.g. `v0.1.1`) and optionally the **commit hash** from the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/releases) page. This allows independent verification that the specification snapshot matches the release assets (PDF, ZIP, checksums).
3. **Evidence alignment**: State in your submission which AIMO Standard version (e.g. `v0.1.1`) your evidence bundle aligns with, and obtain the validator and schemas from that same release.

## Version layers

AIMO Standard uses three version concepts. For the current release they are aligned; future releases may version them independently.

| Layer | Description | Where it appears |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Standard version** (site/release) | The release tag and documentation snapshot (e.g. `v0.1.1`). | Versions table, GitHub Releases, `/X.Y.Z/` URLs. |
| **Taxonomy schema version** | Version of the code system and taxonomy/schema definitions. | `taxonomy_version` in manifests; schema `$id` or docs. |
| **Dictionary content version** | Version of the dictionary entries (codes and definitions). | Dictionary metadata; same as taxonomy for 0.0.x. |

When citing "AIMO Standard vX.Y.Z", the **Standard version** is the one that defines the canonical snapshot. The Validator and Minimum Evidence Requirements refer to the artifacts and schemas of that release.

## Verification Procedure

Auditors and implementers should verify download integrity using SHA-256 checksums:

### 1. Download Release Assets

=== "Linux / macOS"

    ```bash
    # Download all assets for a specific version
    VERSION=v0.1.2
    BASE_URL="https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/releases/download/${VERSION}"

    curl -LO "${BASE_URL}/trust_package.pdf"
    curl -LO "${BASE_URL}/trust_package.ja.pdf"
    curl -LO "${BASE_URL}/aimo-standard-artifacts.zip"
    curl -LO "${BASE_URL}/SHA256SUMS.txt"
    ```

=== "Windows (PowerShell)"

    ```powershell
    # Download all assets for a specific version
    $VERSION = "v0.1.1"
    $BASE_URL = "https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/releases/download/$VERSION"

    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "$BASE_URL/trust_package.pdf" -OutFile trust_package.pdf
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "$BASE_URL/trust_package.ja.pdf" -OutFile trust_package.ja.pdf
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "$BASE_URL/aimo-standard-artifacts.zip" -OutFile aimo-standard-artifacts.zip
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "$BASE_URL/SHA256SUMS.txt" -OutFile SHA256SUMS.txt
    ```

### 2. Verify Checksums

=== "Linux"

    ```bash
    # Verify all downloaded files against checksums
    sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt

    # Expected output (all should show "OK"):
    # trust_package.pdf: OK
    # trust_package.ja.pdf: OK
    # aimo-standard-artifacts.zip: OK
    ```

=== "macOS"

    ```bash
    # Verify all downloaded files against checksums
    shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS.txt

    # Expected output (all should show "OK"):
    # trust_package.pdf: OK
    # trust_package.ja.pdf: OK
    # aimo-standard-artifacts.zip: OK
    ```

=== "Windows (PowerShell)"

    ```powershell
    # Verify each file
    Get-FileHash .\trust_package.pdf -Algorithm SHA256
    Get-FileHash .\trust_package.ja.pdf -Algorithm SHA256
    Get-FileHash .\aimo-standard-artifacts.zip -Algorithm SHA256

    # Compare Hash output with SHA256SUMS.txt
    Get-Content .\SHA256SUMS.txt
    ```

### 3. Manual Verification (Alternative)

=== "Linux"

    ```bash
    # Compute hash for a specific file
    sha256sum trust_package.pdf

    # Compare output with SHA256SUMS.txt
    cat SHA256SUMS.txt
    ```

=== "macOS"

    ```bash
    # Compute hash for a specific file
    shasum -a 256 trust_package.pdf

    # Compare output with SHA256SUMS.txt
    cat SHA256SUMS.txt
    ```

=== "Windows (PowerShell)"

    ```powershell
    # Compute hash for a specific file
    Get-FileHash .\trust_package.pdf -Algorithm SHA256

    # View checksums file
    Get-Content .\SHA256SUMS.txt
    ```

!!! tip "For Auditors"
    Always obtain the checksums file directly from the official GitHub Release, not from the submitting party. This ensures independent verification.

### 4. Verify Build Provenance (Attestation)

All release assets include cryptographically signed build provenance attestations generated by GitHub Actions. This allows you to verify that assets were built in the official repository without tampering.

**Prerequisites**: Install [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`)

```bash
# Download release assets using GitHub CLI
VERSION=v0.1.2
gh release download "$VERSION" --repo billyrise/aimo-standard

# Verify attestation for each asset
gh attestation verify trust_package.pdf --repo billyrise/aimo-standard
gh attestation verify trust_package.ja.pdf --repo billyrise/aimo-standard
gh attestation verify aimo-standard-artifacts.zip --repo billyrise/aimo-standard
gh attestation verify SHA256SUMS.txt --repo billyrise/aimo-standard
```

**Expected output** (success):

```
Loaded digest sha256:abc123... for file trust_package.pdf
Loaded 1 attestation from GitHub API
✓ Verification succeeded!
```

**Offline verification** (air-gapped environments):

```bash
# First, download the trusted root (requires network once)
gh attestation trusted-root > trusted-root.jsonl

# Then verify offline
gh attestation verify trust_package.pdf \
  --repo billyrise/aimo-standard \
  --custom-trusted-root trusted-root.jsonl
```

!!! info "What attestation proves"
    Build provenance attestation cryptographically proves that the release assets were:

    1. Built by GitHub Actions (not a developer's local machine)
    2. Built from the official `billyrise/aimo-standard` repository
    3. Built from the exact commit associated with the release tag
    4. Not modified after the build completed

## Compatibility

AIMO Standard follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer):

| Change Type | Version Bump | Impact |
| :---------- | :----------- | :----- |
| **MAJOR** | X.0.0 | Breaking changes — migration required |
| **MINOR** | 0.X.0 | Backward-compatible additions |
| **PATCH** | 0.0.X | Fixes and clarifications |

For the **operational policy** (URL semantics and MUST rules), see [Versioning & Reference Policy](../current/00-versioning-reference-policy/). For the complete versioning policy, see [VERSIONING.md](https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/blob/main/VERSIONING.md).

## Migration

When upgrading between versions with breaking changes:

1. Check the [Changelog](../current/08-changelog/) for breaking changes
2. Review the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/blob/main/MIGRATION.md) for specific upgrade paths
3. Update your Evidence Bundle to align with the new schema requirements
4. Re-run the validator to verify compliance

!!! warning "Breaking Changes"
    MAJOR version updates may require changes to existing Evidence Bundles. Always review the migration guide before upgrading.

## Versioned Documentation Snapshots

Each release creates a frozen documentation snapshot accessible at:

- Production: `https://standard.aimoaas.com/{version}/` (e.g., `/0.1.1/`)
- GitHub Pages: `https://billyrise.github.io/aimo-standard/{version}/`

### URL Types and Their Meaning

| URL Pattern | Description | For Audit Citations? |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| `/X.Y.Z/` (e.g., `/0.1.1/`) | **Frozen release** — immutable snapshot | **Yes** (preferred) |
| `/latest/` | **Alias** — redirects to most recent release | Yes (resolves to `/X.Y.Z/`) |
| `/dev/` | **Preview** — unreleased main branch content | **No** (not for citations) |

!!! warning "Understanding `/latest/` vs `/dev/`"
    - **`/latest/`** is an alias (redirect) to the most recent **released** version. It is safe for citations as it resolves to a frozen snapshot.
    - **`/dev/`** reflects the current `main` branch and may contain **unreleased changes**. Never cite `/dev/` in audit reports.

### FAQ

??? question "Why is `/latest/` not a version number?"
    `/latest/` is a convenience alias that always redirects to the most recent stable release (e.g., `/0.1.1/`). This allows users to bookmark a single URL while automatically getting the current version. For formal audits requiring immutability, cite the explicit version URL instead.

??? question "Which URL should auditors cite?"
    - **Formal audits (immutability required)**: Use `/X.Y.Z/` (e.g., `https://standard.aimoaas.com/0.1.1/standard/current/`)
    - **General references**: `/latest/` is acceptable as it redirects to the current release
    - **Never cite**: `/dev/` (unreleased, subject to change)

??? question "What if `/latest/` shows different content than expected?"
    This would be a deployment bug. If you suspect `/latest/` differs from the most recent [GitHub Release](https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/releases), please [report an issue](https://github.com/billyrise/aimo-standard/issues). The `/latest/` alias should always redirect to the most recent tagged release.
